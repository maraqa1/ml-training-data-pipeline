524,"There are c103M refugees in the world (UNHCR 2022), with c33M needing life-sustaining heating in locations where the temperature drops below 10°C in the winter months or during night hours (InfoMigrants 2022). The impact of the cold weather is enormous, with numerous life-threatening health impacts. 6.3M refugee households need safer, better, greener heating (UNHCR 2022). Current heating methods include diesel heaters and burning of materials such as kerosene, firewood and bottled gas, leading to fires, releases of toxic fumes and harm to the environment. UNHCR reported 1100 deaths from refugee campfires in 2021 alone. Current heating methods are very expensive, cUSD300/refugee household/year (IEA 2022). Alternatives such as firewood are cheaper but use vital resources, are high in CO2 impact and present safety and exclusion risks for women collecting the wood (Erin 2007). Removing the need to burn firewood in refugee camps would save c1.5m tonnes CO2/year (UNHCR 2020). Solar PV systems can reduce CO2 emissions by 45 to 70g CO2/kWh) compared to fossil fuel-based solutions (IEA 2021). With PV costs dropping by 80% between 2010-20 (IRENA 2021), opportunities to unlock clean power for heating solutions are becoming financially viable. ,Mat Zero can alleviate these issues through its innovative solar-powered heating solution. The project will target how to integrate design for repair within the product to increase the longevity of the product from a user-centric approach and outline the social impact around job creation for local repair and recycling teams.,,The goals of the project are:,,1.

261,"Almost 460,000 people a year are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer across the world, with the number of cases predicted to rise by 6% over the coming decades due to a plateau in research developments and therapeutic advancements. Unfortunately, due to non-specific symptoms which often present late, and the current sub-optimal diagnostic tests for pancreatic cancer, it is often only diagnosed in the later stages of the disease, and usually when it has already spread to secondary locations. The survival statistics are alarming, with less than 30% of patients suitable candidates for receiving any surgery or treatment after diagnosis and over 75% of patients do not survive for more than a year. ,The current blood test for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is wholly inadequate, being only raised in ~50% of cases, also raised in a plethora of other benign unrelated conditions, or does not detect the cancer until late in the disease progression. Furthermore, there is currently no screening tool for people who are at high risk of developing pancreatic cancer.,,GenoME builds on its success with OvaME, a blood test for early detection of ovarian cancer. We are now aiming to develop a simple blood test which detects specific modifications of DNA (DNA methylation) which are present in the early stages of pancreatic cancer. Our candidate DNAme markers display potential superior accuracy and reliability over the current pancreatic cancer blood test, potentially improving the survival and quality of life of those affected. Whilst this test, PanME, will initially be launched as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic individuals, the long-term ambition for GenoME is to market the test as the world's first screening tool for pancreatic cancer. Post launch, this would require a larger long-term clinical validation in order to define a pancreatic screening programme.,,The PanME pancreatic cancer test is the second product for the company. Successful demonstration of applying our platform technology to a new disease area will enable us to raise the further critical funds required to expand our biomarker development for not just other cancer types but also a multitude of various other diseases which have classically lacked in research and diagnostic improvements or knowledge, such as endometriosis.","Topic: Cancer research and diagnostic improvements Domain: Medical Level 1: Cancer diagnosis and treatments Level 2: Early detection and screening tools for pancreatic cancer","Medical","Cancer diagnosis and treatments","Early detection and screening tools for pancreatic cancer","Medical Cancer diagnosis and treatments Early detection and screening tools for pancreatic cancer","Healthcare","Research and Development/Economy"

528,"The recent innovations in Artificial Intelligence have sent disrupting waves across all industries, and across the Education sector in particular. Schools around the world have banned the use of ChatGPT, fearing its impact on learning, while edtech startups embraced the opportunity to lower barriers to education. The divide between offline and online learning grows stronger, and schools and higher education are forced to offer hybrid approaches to learning. ,Knowledge has become a commodity. To remain relevant and economically competitive, learning institutions need to adapt, and refocus their pedagogical approach not on the knowledge itself, but on its delivery mechanisms, such that students will thrive in their learning, be supported when encountering difficulties and be enticed to continuously learn.,,This project is led by Music Hackspace, an online learning platform for music technologies, and the Creative Computing Institute of University of the Arts London. It focuses on studying the feasibility of personalised learning journeys, using an existing repository of over 300 on-demand courses created by Music Hackspace between 2020 and 2023\. The project will analyse the transcripts of Music Hackspace courses to help students discover new content and decide what to study, with a conversational tool that offers bespoke advice based on student needs and contexts.,,Both teams have collaborated on a IUK grant in 2021, to build a Machine Learning powered engine to rank courses by complexity. This project is a continuation of the successful research started then, but which didn't use large language models. The teams have an existing codebase and prototype, a clear IP strategy, and are used to working together.,,This project leverages three key components: (1) the world-class Machine Learning and music technology expertise of Prof Rebecca Fiebrink's team, (2) the experience of teaching online and in-person of academics and professionals, (3) a thriving startup ideally positioned to integrate the results of this research to gain traction and market share.,,Statista estimates the global e-learning market to grow CAGR 9.84%(2023:£133B,2027:£191B), while the global music e-learning segment grows twice as fast (2023: £174M,2027:£341M/CAGR:18.40%, Research&Markets), highlighting an urgent need to bolster the UK position in this rapidly growing sector.

21,"Our planet is drowning in waste. Globally, around a third of all food produced is lost or wasted, which contributes between 8 and 10 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, if food waste were a country, it would have the third-biggest carbon footprint after the USA and China (UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, 2019). ,This topic is now gathering attention as the UN is aiming to halve food waste per capita, by 2030 as part of their twelfth sustainable development goal. The UK Government has also committed to halving the UK's per capita food waste by 2030.,,The solution/product system is called Nourish. This project will develop a product system to reduce household waste.

582,"This is a proposal for a new software tool, Cobalt Grant Manager, to utilise machine learning to help understand economic exploitation data to better inform investment decisions and to help improve the accuracy of expenditure claims forecasting to schedule projects more effectively. Innovate UK will play an integral role in the forthcoming UK National Innovation Plan having responsibility to de-risk, enable and support innovation within the UK. To meet this responsibility, a key objective for Innovate UK is to maximise the benefit of innovation for the UK economy into the next decade. This requires Innovate UK to undertsand the economic impact of their funding and to control their budget well so as to avoid missed opportunities. Having invested around £1.8 billion in innovation since 2007, Innovate UK has a need to understand the economic impact of their investments to ensure the quality of future investments. Ten years' worth of investments means that data is available to analyse not only short-term effects of funding, but also mid- and longer-term impacts, such as company growth indicators. Application of machine learning to this data will provide insights into economic exploitation and help inform future decisions. Innovate UK is tasked with not over-spending, but also not under-spending by more than 1%, against allocated core budget, which leaves little margin for error in the spend targets and budget control. However, grant recipient expenditure claim forecasts are not typically accurate to within the 1% variance, but rather around 10%. A 10% underspend across numerous projects results in substantial missed opportunities. For example a 10% error across the core budget of £550 million would be £55.0 million, an amount that could have funded additional innovation projects. With no expected improvement in current forecasts, this problem needs an innovative solution to help tackle it. Using our data platform, Analytics Engines XDP™, we will bring together data and systems from across Innovate UK, third parties and open data, creating a single view of all the information available. Then using inbuilt advanced analytics capabilities, we will apply machine learning and predictive models to aid in tackling these problems. The purpose of the project is to develop a tool that will automatically provide Innovate UK with real-time monitoring information about their investments and costs. We will also build predictive models based on recipient forecasts, historical data, business/organisation data and other data to predict actual costs and economic impact of investments. This will allow Innovate UK to make more informed investment decisions and to take action to minimise underspend. The tool will be based on proven machine learning techniques using large volumes of data to identify patterns and categorise events from disparate data sets, becoming more accurate and efficient as the models are trained and the data available increases."," Domain: Government Funded Investments Level 1: Maximizing Economic Impact Level 2: Utilizing Machine Learning to Improve Investment Decisions and Control Budgets.

69,"RevoNA is an emerging spin-out from the University of Portsmouth (UoP) that aims to revolutionise the discovery of new drugs targeting ribonucleic acids (RNAs). It has been known for some time that RNA is the key mechanism by which information in DNA (the blueprint of life) is used to create proteins (the building blocks of life), but the full importance of RNA in regulating the biological processes of life has only recently been revealed. Over 100,000 RNAs have now been identified in the body and it is recognised that targeting RNAs with drugs has the potential to treat both viral and bacterial infections, as well as offering new hope across a rapidly increasing range of diseases, including cancer, cardiac dysfunction, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. While RNA drugs are undoubtedly at the leading edge of pharmaceutical innovation, whether they ultimately play a key role in reducing the global burden of disease is dependent on increasing the pace and breadth of RNA research and development. This will only be achieved if the significant limitations to screening RNA target/drug interactions can be addressed, as existing methods are either slow, costly and labour intensive, or fast, but provide minimal information. ,RevoNA has demonstrated and patented a technology which enables the fast, effective and low-cost screening of RNA target-drug interactions. This project focuses on exploiting our proven technology to launch a company delivering RNA screening service partnerships to RNA therapeutic research and development (R&D) organisations. This project will deliver quality assurance technical data packs and case studies which are important precursors to business development, further investment and sustainable commercial success as they will demonstrate the superiority and benefits of our technology over the limited existing approaches.,,Our research was ahead of its time, but our market engagement shows the rapidly growing RNA drug sector would hugely benefit from our technology now. Public investment will enable the UK to be at the forefront of a new market in RNA screening partnerships which will capitalise on the rapidly expanding field of RNA drug development. This is particularly topical as COVID-19 has prompted public interest in RNA more generally. With the weight of RNA drug development currently occurring in the US, RevoNA offers a step-change in capability and potential for the UK to access this market and by unlocking UK RNA drug development, provide an opportunity to increase the UK's role in addressing the global burden of disease."," Domain: Pharmaceutical Industry Level 1: RNA Drug Development Level 2: Rapid and Affordable RNA Target-Drug Interaction Screening","Pharmaceutical Industry","RNA Drug Development","Rapid and Affordable RNA Target-Drug Interaction Screening","Pharmaceutical Industry RNA Drug Development Rapid and Affordable RNA Target-Drug Interaction Screening","Research and Development","Pharmaceutical Industry"
435,"The in-pond harsh environment closed loop variable buoyancy lifting device relies on the Archimedes principle. Archimedes principle states that a body partially or completely immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body. By changing the volume of displaced fluid, the device creates a variable lifting force. The novel application is to use a closed loop in which the inflation air is stored under pressure in a receiver. This compressed air inflates the variable displacement to provide lift. To submerge the air is transferred back into the receiver via a compressor and a series of control valves. The small observation class ROV systems currently being operated on the Sellafield site will be able to manoeuvre the suspended load. This can be most clearly demonstrated how historically during the era of canal transportation a horse could easily pull a fully laden 100 ton barge along a canal.","Domain: Marine Technology Level 1: Underwater Vehicles Level 2: Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices Domain: Marine Technology Level 1: Underwater Vehicles Level 2: Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices","Marine Technology","Underwater Vehicles","Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices Domain: Marine Technology Level 1: Underwater Vehicles Level 2: Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices","Marine Technology Underwater Vehicles Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices Domain: Marine Technology Level 1: Underwater Vehicles Level 2: Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices","Transport","Water Transportation"

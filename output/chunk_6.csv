175,"The overall objective of the project is to perfect a system for encapsulating a wood veneer into a glass fibre moulding for the application of racing boats. Many boat owners desire boats that have an aesthetically pleasing authentic wooden finish, which are still suitable for racing. However, in the recent years wooden boats sales have fallen due to their significant expense and slow production time due to the labour intensive building methods used, and time consuming and expensive annual maintenance of finishing the boats. There is a business opportunity for us to offer a Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) protected, infused wood veneer boat, which would have the benefits of a modern GRP manufactured process combined with the traditional look of a wooden finish. The advantages to the boat purchaser include a great looking “wooden” boat which is attractive to the traditional buyers at a competitive price with lower maintenance costs. It would also help open up the market to non-competitive sailors. The return on investment for this Experimental Development project cost is 200% over 5 years, helping grow our sales 50% above current levels and maintaining or even increasing our current level of exports from 80% by year 5 post commercialisation."," Domain: Maritime Technology Level 1: Wood Veneer and Glass Fibre Composite Boats Level 2: Development of GRP Infused Wood Veneer Boats for Racing Applications","Maritime Technology","Wood Veneer and Glass Fibre Composite Boats","Development of GRP Infused Wood Veneer Boats for Racing Applications","Maritime Technology Wood Veneer and Glass Fibre Composite Boats Development of GRP Infused Wood Veneer Boats for Racing Applications","Manufacturing","Shipbuilding/Boatbuilding"

408,"Company: Niander Aurora Limited (Aurora): Aurora have developed an initial digital and have a highly experienced team with extensive industry experience, supported by UK/global advisory board of top insurance providers. ,Aurora is a holistic, digital platform seeking to augment how commercial insurance is purchased and managed. Working with customers on a direct basis or via selected broking partners, we cater to micro, small and medium businesses.,,With Aurora, customers can get personalised, real-time quotations, compare insurance providers and transfer and mitigate risk in a uniquely tailor-made way. All while benefiting from analytics and data driven education and advice.,,Issue/demand: Aurora have been approached by the insurance industry and SMEs to resolve a continuing unmet/unresolved market need. Traditionally insurers sell off-the-shelf package products with coverages that a customer may not need, as well as coverages missing that they do need. This may be due to some insurers only offering types of covers or insurance within specific segments or may be an amalgamation of the cheapest insurance quote by cover. Also, it is acknowledged by insurers that these policies have evolved incrementally, resulting in very large, hard to read/inconsistent documents with conflicting wording and policy limits.,,Solution: To develop Aurora's Algorithmic Trading (AT-AURORA) - an innovative digital trading product to meet market need by delivering uniquely tailor personalised packages of insurance cover online in 15mins (instead of industry standard of 4/5 weeks) with each cover priced individually and amalgamated in real-time into an appropriate, single, coherent (understandable) insurance package. Project funding will be to design, develop and deliver an MVP consisting of three modules: a co-insurance mechanism, computable contracts proposition, and algorithmic trading/underwriting, each interoperable with Aurora's existing platform."," Domain: Insurtech Level 1: Digital Platform for Commercial Insurance Level 2: Algorithmic Trading for Personalized Insurance Packages","Insurtech","Digital Platform for Commercial Insurance","Algorithmic Trading for Personalized Insurance Packages","Insurtech Digital Platform for Commercial Insurance Algorithmic Trading for Personalized Insurance Packages","Economy","Insurance Industry/Small and Medium Businesses"
207,"CherSoft are a leading supplier of charts and navigation technology to maritime users. Over the last three years we have developed the concept of the Universal Chart Server (UCS). This,is in response to a unique market opportunity, arising from future requirements for,commercial vessels in terms of electronic chart supply. These require commercial vessels to,carry Electronic Chart and Display Systems (ECDIS) from 2017. Up to date Electronic,Navigation Chart (ENC) data is essential and a legal requirement for their correct use.,Authorities may impound vessels without updated charts and impose fines of $50,000 a day,on the owners. Operators also lose precious ‘slots’ in at-capacity shipping lanes. Our,commercial experience has taught us that maritime shipping is slow to adopt internet,technology. Intuitively, this is due to the high cost of satellite connectivity, which is the only,practical mechanism for offshore vessels to access the internet. Furthermore, vessels incur,large fees associated with the necessary data subscription tariffs. Data transfer via satellites,typically costs several $ a minute via a data subscription, or costing vessels $9,500 per year on,an annual tariff.,We propose meeting these badly met market needs by developing a universal chart integration,and display system that integrates all 15,000 charts from all major global providers in a single,coherent form. We will deliver an innovative step change through new compression and,decompression technology that will reduce the bandwidth requirements for satellite ENC,updating. We will make ENC update leaner still, by targeting only essential and relevant,information. Our target is a 50% reduction in total data transferred per update. This will,significantly reduce the user’s costs, from individual sailor to commercial fleet alike.,Enhanced safety from 24/7 updated maps, bringing all users in line with necessary legislative,compliance are further benefits."," Domain: Maritime Technology Level 1: Maritime Navigation and Charts Level 2: Universal Chart Server (UCS) and Electronic Chart and Display Systems (ECDIS)","Maritime Technology","Maritime Navigation and Charts","Universal Chart Server (UCS) and Electronic Chart and Display Systems (ECDIS)","Maritime Technology Maritime Navigation and Charts Universal Chart Server (UCS) and Electronic Chart and Display Systems (ECDIS)","Transportation and Logistics","Technology/Navigation and Charting"
234,"Creative Composites, Engenuity Ltd, WMG and Simutence will be working together with Spirit Aerosystems to develop a new software solution to predict the structural performance of SMC composite materials and enable their use in aerospace applications. SMC is a discontinuous fibre, moulded composite commonly used for performance automotive applications. Its carbon fibre reinforced variants (known as C-SMC) can have higher specific strength and stiffness than aluminium, with lower material cost and cycle time than continuous CFRP. ,The consortium will develop a software tool that can accurately predict the variable behaviour of these materials taking into account the effect of flow during moulding. Bridging a gap in predictive analysis and opening up the aerospace industry to more applications of this low-cost, light weighting technology. The project will include the design optimisation and manufacture of a structural aircraft component to validate this new software tool, and demonstrate how it can enable C-SMC to compete with conventional aerospace materials."," Domain: Aerospace Technology Level 1: Predictive Analysis and Design Optimization Level 2: Composite Material Applications in Aerospace Industry","Aerospace Technology","Predictive Analysis and Design Optimization","Composite Material Applications in Aerospace Industry","Aerospace Technology Predictive Analysis and Design Optimization Composite Material Applications in Aerospace Industry","Aerospace","Automotive Design/Advanced Materials"

Our hybrid powertrain utilises aeronautic developments in materials,and design to enable airships to fly with greater manoeuvrability coping with building,turbulence in Canary Wharf or differences in extreme weather. The hybrid powertrain,comprises both state of the art H2 + O turbine power optimised combustion with the speed of,instantaneous fuel cell electrical power to respond to any adverse weather condition. This,versatile and scalable powertrain will take the form of a heavy lifter airship of multiple 5MW,gas turbine / Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units. The,system includes fuel control, storage, management and supply, from renewable fuels to,virtually eliminate emissions and increase airship stability to carry payloads over terrain,where it has superiority over other transport managing logistically cargo of varying loads,shapes, mass, volume and states of matter safely. The hybrid turbine ultra-thrust with electric,propulsion assist enables variable morphology, exact manoeuvring, improved velocity,,decreased response times with virtually instantaneous max torque, providing dual power,safety whilst facilitating lift with high temperature H2 and oxygenated turbine fuel,enrichment for instantaneous power demand response."," Domain: Aeronautics Level 1: Hybrid Powertrain for Lighter Than Air Vehicles Level 2: Heavy Lifter Airship with Combined Heat and Power Units","Aeronautics","Hybrid Powertrain for Lighter Than Air Vehicles","Heavy Lifter Airship with Combined Heat and Power Units","Aeronautics Hybrid Powertrain for Lighter Than Air Vehicles Heavy Lifter Airship with Combined Heat and Power Units","Aerospace","Energy/Air Transportation"
228,"SAMULET II Project 10: Fast Make delivers rapid manufacturing capability for aerospace applications in the United Kingdom (UK). In order to deliver fit for purpose parts parts to demonstrator projects and engine production programmes within accelerated lead times there is the need to develop new and innovative manufacturing and modelling technologies that meet the aerospace quality requirements within a much compressed timescale. Fast Make requires an integrated approach and brings together ‘fast business processes’, ‘fast make’ and ‘fast processing’ to achieve a step change in development lead-times. This capability will maximise timely technology insertion to enhance product competitiveness. This is a collaborative programme utilising the skills and competencies within the High Value Manufacturing CATAPULT and University network. The results of the research will be validated and delivered by the manufacture of first-off parts and system demonstrations."," Domain: Aerospace Manufacturing Level 1: Rapid Manufacturing Capability Possible Level 2: Innovative Technologies for Aerospace Quality Compliance","Aerospace Manufacturing","Rapid Manufacturing Capability Possible","Innovative Technologies for Aerospace Quality Compliance","Aerospace Manufacturing Rapid Manufacturing Capability Possible Innovative Technologies for Aerospace Quality Compliance","Manufacturing","Aerospace/Technology and Innovation"
263,"**VISION** ,Algreen developed sustainable and cost-effective chipboards from natural seaweed and wastepaper. Algreen chipboard using eco-friendly seaweed-based adhesive rather than petrol-based adhesive to glue the wastepaper chips. Thanks to Algreen's novel technology, Algreen chipboard is high-scalable, environmentally sustainable and VOC-free.,,**PROBLEM**,,Traditionally, chipboard is made by mixing particles or flakes of wood or jute-stick together with a resin and forming the mixture into a sheet. Chipboard is widely used for building construction and household furniture such as kitchen cabinets, bookcases, doors, windows, and covering the walls and floor.,,Most commercial chipboard is environmentally unfriendly, which contains highly toxic and carcinogenic adhesive, formaldehyde, which releases formaldehyde gas (VOC) into the atmosphere. Furniture containing formaldehyde can continue emitting small amounts of gas for up to 10 years.,,**MARKET**,,The global chipboard market reached a value of £15 Billion in 2020 (CAGR of 4.4% during 2021-2026).,,Countries including China, the United States, and Germany account for the largest markets in the furniture industry. China is the dominant exporter of wood furniture to the EU.,,China is the largest market base in the Asia-Pacific region, owing to its ever-increasing population, rising income, and rapid urbanization. It is also one of the major manufacturing hubs for almost every industry.,,After COVID, market recovery is speculated to be witnessed. Thus, the projected growing construction and furniture industries are expected to boost the demand in the local particle boards market in the post-pandemic recovery period.,,**ALGREEN SUSTAINABILITY**,,Recycling is a key global environmental concern, but especially when it comes to paper. Not only does it help to save trees, which is crucial to the sustainability of our planet, but recycling one tonne of paper, also saves at least 30,000 litres of water and between 3000 to 4000 kWh of electricity. This is enough to sustain an average three-bedroomed house for a whole year. Producing recycled paper also requires between 28-70% less energy consumption and uses less water.,,Open ocean seaweed farms can improve water quality. The World Bank predicts that achieving a global production of 500 million tons of seaweed by 2050 would absorb 10 million tons of nitrogen, which is 30% of the nitrogen estimated to enter the ocean, and 15 million tons of phosphorus. That same seaweed production of 500 million tons would consume 135 million tons of carbon, which is 3.2% of the carbon added to seawater each year from GHGs emissions."," Domain: Sustainable Materials Level 1: Alternative Materials for Construction and Furniture Level 2: Seaweed-based Chipboard in the Global Market ","Sustainable Materials","Alternative Materials for Construction and Furniture","Seaweed-based Chipboard in the Global Market ","Sustainable Materials Alternative Materials for Construction and Furniture Seaweed-based Chipboard in the Global Market","Manufacturing","Agriculture/Recycling/Construction/Furniture/Environmental Science"

115,"We are looking at the steps required to build a hardware and software based service to record and summarise mental health therapy sessions. It's important for a number of reasons ,* Mental Health trust CEOs expect COVID-19 to induce a significant surge in demand but services have been running close to 100% capacity during the lockdown due to the adoption of telehealth but there's no surplus capacity,* Current vacancy rates for medial personnel in the NHS mental trusts runs at 12.4%, double that for the rest of the NHS exacerbating the situation,* Less than 2m of the 12m a year in the UK with a diagnosable mental health condition get professional help which translates to a estimated cost to the UK of £100Bn (Chief medical officer NHS 2014),,Therapists currently spend 1½ -2 hours a day writing up their notes. Automating the generation of a summary immediately at the end of a session could save an hour a day. The therapist just needs to add their therapeutic notes to the automated summary rather than recall the full session.,,The time saved could allow therapists to offer at least 1 extra session a day which would be a 20% boost in productivity for the NHS. Other benefits are the notes would be more consistent across sessions as unlike therapists, computers are more consistent than humans at boring tasks. They're not subject to the problems of poor human recall, cognitive bias and noise in human decision making. Our technology addresses the problems of privacy and confidentiality by giving control to the people in the room and not some remote cloud based solution with vulnerabilities to hackers. One of the more exciting possibilities is there may be therapeutic effects but that needs to be explored in a subsequent project.,,This project is about extending the technology we have already developed and finding partners in the therapist community to collaborate with to test our assumptions and produce an experimental prototype and a project plan that could provide the basis for a custom designed device to provide a platform for mental health therapists and patients. That would offer the potential to revolutionise training, mental health practice and eventually to revolutionise mental heath care the world over."," Domain: Mental Health Therapy Sessions Level 1: Developing an Automated Summary System Level 2: Implementation and Testing with Therapist Community Collaboration","Mental Health Therapy Sessions","Developing an Automated Summary System","Implementation and Testing with Therapist Community Collaboration","Mental Health Therapy Sessions Developing an Automated Summary System Implementation and Testing with Therapist Community Collaboration","Technology","Healthcare/Education"
665,"This application is focused on the development of novel ways of understanding who might be at risk of having psychotic disorders. Psychosis is a highly challenging mental health condition and will typically result in the individual suffering from hallucinations and delusions. Psychotic episodes can be incredibly dangerous and lead to life changing trauma and fatalities. The condition is a huge burden on the individual, their family, loved ones and the healthcare system. The only way of spotting the warning signs of psychosis today is via direct consultation with a healthcare professional. Consequently, there are many in our society with undiagnosed early-stage psychosis, which poses significant risks to both themselves and those around them. ,The applicants, presenting this application, are leading researchers in the use of digital technologies for the detection of psychosis. In simple terms, this team is developing a set of intuitive tasks that prompt one to speak into a mobile phone and record one's speech patterns. Their initial research has shown that it is then, in principle, possible for software to analyse these spoken responses and determine whether an individual has low, medium or high risk of psychosis. The ultimate goal is to develop a simple and low cost application that can be prescribed to patients to quickly evaluate their risk of psychosis. This would enable high risk individuals to be identified for relevant medical intervention.,,This team of researchers has started a company to develop this software. The vital next step in the development is to conduct a feasibility study to determine if their software prototype is able to discriminate between healthy and higher risk persons from a group of volunteer users. The enclosed application is focused on a programme of R&D to test and refine the diagnostic performance of the software.,,If the team is able to successfully demonstrate that the software works in principle, they will be in a far better position to gain support from clinicians and investors. They will be able to secure the support they need to conduct the formal clinical studies needed to demonstrate the benefits of the solution and its value to healthcare providers.","Domain: Mental Health Level 1: Psychosis Level 2: Early Detection and Diagnosis Domain: Mental Health Level 1: Psychosis Level 2: Digital Technology for Detection","Mental Health","Psychosis","Early Detection and Diagnosis Domain: Mental Health Level 1: Psychosis Level 2: Digital Technology for Detection","Mental Health Psychosis Early Detection and Diagnosis Domain: Mental Health Level 1: Psychosis Level 2: Digital Technology for Detection",NA,NA

157,"This project aims to develop a universal solar roof tile which could be installed on any roof with any roof tile. Existing solar roof tiles have been limited in their application as compatible,with only a subset of the wide range of roof tiles on the market.,Universality requires the development of a set of robust and cost effective interfaces between,the photovoltaic (PV) tile and the remainder of the roof, including ridges, verges, gutters and a,wide set of geometries. The opportunity is to create the solar equivalent of a Velux window –,universal in its application, cost competitive with traditional solutions and aesthetically,appealing. Fundamentally, it should perform the weatherproofing function of a roof, but also,generate electricity.,The bulk of today’s PV products use a limited palette of materials – notably aluminium and,glass – to create the physical package. This proof of concept will explore a wider set of,materials and manufacturing processes as avenues to potential cost reductions to the non “PVcell”,elements of the system. These investigations and the design should enable ongoing cost,reduction (see appended GTM graph).,Solar cell costs continue to fall so the portion of the final installed cost for a PV system which,relates to mounting structure and installation costs is becoming more important. A universal,solar roof tile will help to reduce the installed cost for PV by utilising existing construction,skills, namely roofers, and removing the need for a costly support structure by using the,building itself as support.,Lowering the overall costs of ownership for a universal PV product means that the number of,roofs which can be used for solar generation will increase. The more consumers that access,solar electricity, the greater the contribution to lowering carbon and reduction of consumer,exposure to rising electricity prices. It also allows consumers to take advantage of the Clean,Energy Cash Back incentive scheme introduced in Apr 2010"," Domain: Renewable Energy Level 1: Universal Solar Roof Tile Level 2: Development of robust and cost-effective interfaces for PV installation on various roof types","Renewable Energy","Universal Solar Roof Tile","Development of robust and cost-effective interfaces for PV installation on various roof types","Renewable Energy Universal Solar Roof Tile Development of robust and cost-effective interfaces for PV installation on various roof types",NA,NA
176,"Current commercial Anaerobic Digestion (AD) plants are inefficient, low-tech and large scale, only capable of reliable operation within a very narrow range of operating conditions. New,Generation Biogas is exploiting research by North Wyke Research into AD and modern,process control technology to develop a high throughput Anaerobic Digester (HTAD). A,significant increase in biogas productivity will radically change the economics of small,Anaerobic Digesters and realise an unfulfilled need for Single Farm AD plants and cost,effective sewage processing by Water Companies. Research strongly indicates that a very,significant increase in biogas productivity can be achieved. A payback period for most,feedstocks of the order of 5 years or less is predicted, significantly less for higher energy,feedstocks.,AD takes place primarily in 2 phases: Hydrolysis during which the feedstock is broken down,into simpler soluble organic compounds and Methanogenesis during which the hydrolysed,feedstock is decomposed and synthesised to produce biogas. Recent laboratory research,indicates that significant improvements can be made in the performance of Hydrolysis in,small reactors on a range of feedstocks through the use of thermal, mechanical and enzyme,pre-treatments. The potential gain in performance arise from operation at lower temperatures,leading to lower plant operating costs and at higher rates leading to reduced reactor size and,reduced capital costs. These when employed with enhanced methanogenesis will lead to,significant gains in biogas productivity. The feasibility study will build on that laboratory,research and aim to demonstrate that the Advanced Hydrolysis results can be reproduced at an,industrial scale and applied within the environment of a highly controlled, high throughput,reactor.,A range of pre-treatments will be tested with a variety of feedstocks. The results will be,developed and then applied in a commercial High Throughput Anaerobic Digester."," Domain: Energy Level 1: Anaerobic Digestion Technology Level 2: Advanced Hydrolysis and Methanogenesis for Increased Biogas Productivity","Energy","Anaerobic Digestion Technology","Advanced Hydrolysis and Methanogenesis for Increased Biogas Productivity","Energy Anaerobic Digestion Technology Advanced Hydrolysis and Methanogenesis for Increased Biogas Productivity","Energy","Waste Management/Sustainable Technology"

2,"Imagine scrolling on your phone to find opportunities to give help. Just like Deliveroo, but instead of ordering a take-away you're selecting from opportunities to help an elderly person pick up their shopping, provide a youth-mentoring session or drop off surplus food from your cupboard to a local food bank. Imagine the opportunities are based on your exact postcode, so things show up close-by or are able to be done remotely. Imagine that it's all on-demand, so you can scroll those opportunities, select one right now and instantly be able to go and do it. ,onHand is an early stage corporate volunteering platform, with 100+ corporate partners and over 20,000 app users. Those users delivered over 30,000 good deeds across the UK in 2021\.

83,"The Navimed 3 study follows, and expands upon, the Navimed 1 study. The aim of both studies being to clearly establish, via clinical and other trials, the potential benefits of delivering interactive digital media to patients in hospitals. Working in an NHS context, with UCLH, the team aims to demonstrate and confirm the potential for patient interaction with structured and unstructured digital content to deliver efficiency benefits by assisting the reduction in patient length of stay. This will bring financial and managerial benefits to hospital trusts as well as increasing patient satisfaction via accelerated recovery and a more personalised delivery of care. The delivery platform and technology will open up new opportunities for augmenting patient - care staff interactions and a potential for increasing quality and efficiency of ward services and patient interactions. The underlying technology will have applications in other areas of consumer engagement with important personally relevant/significant information services - where quality and trust are important issues."," Domain: Healthcare Technology Level 1: Digital Media in Hospitals Level 2: Impact on Patient Length of Stay and Hospital Efficiency","Healthcare Technology","Digital Media in Hospitals","Impact on Patient Length of Stay and Hospital Efficiency","Healthcare Technology Digital Media in Hospitals Impact on Patient Length of Stay and Hospital Efficiency","Economy","Research and Development"
459,"**Challenge:**Rice is a staple for nearly half of the world's 7 billion population and is mainly produced in south-east Asia (Mohanty\_2013). As the global population rises, to over nine billion by 2030, there will be huge pressure on land for food -- and rice yields must increase by 25% (Fernandez\_and\_Orth\_2018). However, rice yields are decreasing due to climate change (Zhao\_et\_al\_2017). In addition, rice cultivation accounts for 12% of global methane emissions (World\_Economics\_Forum\_2019), which is 30-times more a potent Green House Gas, than CO2 (National\_Geographic). Today, global rice production is doing as much harm as 1,200 average-sized coal power stations, and by 2030, will be responsible for 6% of total GHG emissions (We\_Forum\_2019). Despite sustained initiatives particularly in China, Japan, Korea and at the International Rice Research institute (IRRI) in the Philippines, established approaches are unable to produce high enough yields, and have effectively plateaued in China, Indonesia, Japan and Korea, and although rising linearly in some key countries such as India and Vietnam, the rates of increase are too slow to meet demand (Grassini\_and\_Cassman\_2013). ,**Solution:** This 24-month industrial research project between NIAB and Tropic advances the state-of-the-art in a plant product (rice) and it's production system (gene editing to increase rice yield), creating a unique UK technology and product export opportunity, and significantly contributes to Net Zero (reducing emissions from rice cultivation), demonstrated through glasshouse trials initially with field performance confirmation latterly (TRL7). We have already demonstrated that we can gene edit favourable traits into a variety of crops (e.g., disease resistant bananas and rice). We will use our previous know-how to build this novel production system, including technical work, utilising Knock-Down and Knock-Out gene editing to modify yield-related regions of interest in rice and select the best rice lines. By the end of this project, we will be in a position then utilise our patented 'GEiGS' technology to create non-GMO rice in several rice varieties, which we will then commercialise. Impact: Increasing rice yield, has the potential to massively cut GHG emissions, whilst producing more grain, and thus keeping the land-mass utilised constant. We have predicted that higher yielding rice could lead to a total CO2 reduction for rain-fed rice of 730 Kg CO2/ha, and for irrigated rice 1330 Kg CO2/ha.,,**_If everyone globally were to consume Tropic's rice, this could equate to savings of 433 million tonnes of CO2 annually_.**"," Domain: Agriculture Level 1: Increasing Rice Yields Level 2: Gene Editing for Yield-related Traits in Rice","Agriculture","Increasing Rice Yields","Gene Editing for Yield-related Traits in Rice","Agriculture Increasing Rice Yields Gene Editing for Yield-related Traits in Rice","Agriculture","Research and Development"

256,"In 2019, Birmingham, the UK's largest local authority, declared a climate emergency and in 2021 approved a Route to Zero (R20) Action Plan setting the priority actions and milestones for the council and wider city to become net-zero by 2030\. Tyseley Energy Park (TEP) and the Tyseley Environmental Enterprise District (TEED) in East Birmingham were a key part of the plan to deliver zero carbon power transport, heat, waste and recycling solutions, as well as business incubation and innovation at the University of Birmingham's Energy Innovation Centre (BEIC) based at TEP. ,In 2023, the TEED strategic partnership formed by Birmingham City Council, University of Birmingham (UoB) and Tyseley Energy Park launched a vision for the area to create the city's Green Energy Innovation Quarter in East Birmingham. The vision builds on the objectives of the East Birmingham Inclusive Growth Strategy to define a clear identity for TEED that reflects the Council's overall commitment to net zero carbon and creating new green jobs, training and business opportunities. The TEED partnership are now developing a Masterplan setting out the initiatives required to deliver the vision. The Fast Followers funding will accelerate this process, and, in turn, the net-zero transition of Birmingham's business sector.,,Birmingham City Council will recruit a Net Zero Innovation Delivery Officer (NZIDO) to work across Council teams and with partners TEP and Birmingham Energy Institute, UoB. The project's aim will be to engage with businesses, workers, entrepreneurs and residents in TEED and wider East Birmingham to co-create a delivery plan for accelerating the net-zero transition for businesses. The vehicle for engaging with businesses will be a Community of Practice (CoP) -- a group of partners, businesses, industry, schools, colleges and organisations brought together with a shared purpose to decarbonise the business sector whilst ensuring economic, social and environmental benefits for the residents of East Birmingham.,,The net-zero delivery plan will build on mapping, data analysis, shared learning and best-practice through 8 CoP workshops and engagement with the wider Fast Followers network to identify transition pathways and a set of investable net-zero projects and funding. The plan will also identify skills gaps and training needs and support to get local people into jobs in the area. By better facilitating and co-ordinating existing governance and resources the NZIDO and the project team make a significant positive impact to accelerate the **Net Zero Transition for Businesses in East Birmingham.**"," Domain: Sustainable Energy Level 1: Net Zero Transition for Businesses Level 2: Green Energy Innovation Quarter in East Birmingham","Sustainable Energy","Net Zero Transition for Businesses","Green Energy Innovation Quarter in East Birmingham","Sustainable Energy Net Zero Transition for Businesses Green Energy Innovation Quarter in East Birmingham","Environmental Science","Economic Development/Research and Development"
617,"The production of n-butanol from fermentation of sugar using Clostridia has tremendous industrial potential (n-butanol is an important chemical intermediate for paints plastics, coatings and polymers). Butanol production via fermentation is sustainable, environmentally friendly and offers a lower cost route than chemical synthesis from oil. However, the conventional fermentation route using Clostridia suffers from low titres and volumetric productivities and a reliance on expensive (and edible) starch-based feedstocks. Commercial implementation requires novel strains with improved fermentation performance and strains capable of fermenting non-food, cellulosic feedstocks. ,Our aim is to develop advanced Clostridia strains. Specific deliverables include:-,,1)	identification and characterisation of alleles (genes) responsible for the desired tolerance traits, using genomic approaches, both in historical strains that were used commercially over four decades and in current production strains following the implementation of novel directed evolution strategies;,2)	transfer of the identified alleles into current, robust production strains, together with rational metabolic engineering to improve product titres;,3)	assessment of strain(s) performance on cellulosic feedstocks at lab and pilot scale."," Domain: Biotechnology Level 1: Sustainable Production of n-Butanol from Fermentation Level 2: Development of Advanced Clostridia Strains","Biotechnology","Sustainable Production of n-Butanol from Fermentation","Development of Advanced Clostridia Strains","Biotechnology Sustainable Production of n-Butanol from Fermentation Development of Advanced Clostridia Strains","Chemicals","Biotechnology/Environmental Science"

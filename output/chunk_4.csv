339,"New Motion Labs (NML) is solving one of the biggest fundamental problems in mechanical engineering, making large mechanical power transfer over a large surface area possible and thereby making traditional gears, roller-chains and belt drives obsolete. NML's vision is to undertake fundamental innovation in the mechanical sector, enabling lightweight and efficient mechanised motion. Initially spun-out from University College London and steered by the Deep Science Ventures Accelerator programme (which provided both guidance on the value proposition and initial pre-seed investment that has been used to manufacture the Proof of Concept). ,**World Changing Drive Technology**,,NML's innovation is the biggest breakthrough in power transmission technology since the invention of the roller-chain first observed in drawings by Leonardo Da Vinci more than 500 years ago. With current chain technology, over 60% of the transmitted power is acting on only one tooth and chain link at any one time, leading to high mechanical wear and is the reason why expensive metals are required for both chains and sprockets.,,NML's chain dramatically reduces wear by sharing the transmitted force over all of the teeth on the sprocket at the same time, this leads to an ~86% reduction in peak stress compared to a conventional roller-chain, enabling a 10 times increase in sprocket lifespan and 3 times increase chain lifespan. Mechanical wear does not have to be a primary consideration anymore; meaning that different materials such as self-lubricating plastics and carbon fibre with additional benefits such as hygiene, cost and weight reductions can be used in chain and transmission design."," Domain: Mechanical Engineering Level 1: Innovative Power Transmission Technology Level 2: Reducing Wear and Increasing Lifespan of Chains and Sprockets","Mechanical Engineering","Innovative Power Transmission Technology","Reducing Wear and Increasing Lifespan of Chains and Sprockets","Mechanical Engineering Innovative Power Transmission Technology Reducing Wear and Increasing Lifespan of Chains and Sprockets","Mechanical/Engineering","Research and Development/Manufacturing"

609,"Leavewell's vision for the project is to confirm the feasibility of pursuing a net zero human body disposal method as a commercial venture in the UK. Cremation is selected for 80% UK deaths creating the following negative environmental impact due to energy consumption and emissions ,Leavewell will develop and promote a natural, organic alternative method. The process generates its own energy therefore energy consumption is minimal, does not produce harmful emissions but does create super rich soil which can be used with the appropriate testing and regulatory approval.,,The feasibility study will cover the following key objectives;,,1. Evaluate the level of consumer demand,2. Assess Cost of Service,,This project has the potential to develop technology and processes that not only creates a net zero human body disposal methods but can positively impact waste management overall.","Domain: Waste management Level 1: Net Zero Human Body Disposal Level 2: Alternative methods Domain: Waste management Level 1: Net Zero Human Body Disposal Level 2: Feasibility Study and Impact Assessment","Waste management","Net Zero Human Body Disposal","Alternative methods Domain: Waste management Level 1: Net Zero Human Body Disposal Level 2: Feasibility Study and Impact Assessment","Waste management Net Zero Human Body Disposal Alternative methods Domain: Waste management Level 1: Net Zero Human Body Disposal Level 2: Feasibility Study and Impact Assessment","Waste Management","Environmental Science/Environmental Technology"
570,"This project is a proof of concept to study the efficacy of a new type of mask for community-based source control. If efficacy can be established, this form of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) will be a new tool for enhancing social distancing and helping to get people back to work in a safe way. We will reframe the requirements analysis for source control PPE, validate emerging approaches, and assess various materials and design approaches. ,The goal is to assess a new type of mask (face gaiter) and compare it to existing masks for suitability as source control for non-medical purposes, to meet government guidelines and the physical requirements of extended work hours, job duties, and related social interaction. The face gaiter resembles existing sport face coverings but is engineered specifically for source control. It is also durable, machine washable and can be reused hundreds of times.,,One objective is to modernise the tools for source control; currently there is a reliance on masks designed for medical or hazardous materials environments, which may or may not be suitable for use by the general public over extended periods of time. Another objective is to help evolve reviews of source control options towards UK and international rating systems.,,The project addresses a long-standing need surfaced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Source control has been used to reduce the transmission rate of bacteria and viruses, such as when sick patients present to hospital. Surgical masks may be issued for source control to a symptomatic patient and to those accompanying the patient to account for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. A key deficiency in such masks is the quality of the seal where the mask meets the face: the masks are poor-fitting; do not accommodate facial hair; lay in close proximity to the mouth; and have low breathability. Taken together, expelled air can escape around the sides of the mask and reduce the effectiveness of this type of source control. All of these issues are addressed by the novel design of the face gaiter.,,When surgical masks are in short supply then a reusable alternative is advantageous. A source control tool suitable for extended use and re-use is timely due to the COVID-19 outbreak and it can support the Government's recovery from the pandemic by limiting the transmission of infection, e.g. in the delivery of essential services and more generally once restrictions on movement start to lift.,,The proof of concept for a novel source control mask conducted under the original project was successful.  The research team designed, tested, and manufactured a re-usable face covering that lets a wearer safely breathe whilst containing potential hazards and minimising leakage.  Under the extension, the research team will carry out tests focused on the protection provided to the wearer by this novel type of face mask.   These tests will evaluate the performance of the mask to protect the wearer from small aerosols within the environment. The test will be carried out on full masks fitted on a breathing mannequin to capture the total performance of the solution. Testing of FFP2 masks, surgical masks, traditional neck gaiters and new “half-face” cloth masks will provide useful comparisons and help reinforce the benefits of this novel design.  Tests for extended durability will be conducted to determine performance after many wash-and-tumble-dry cycles.  A summary of the project’s extensive knowledgebase will then be created to support efforts to standardise the design parameters for non-medical face coverings."," Domain: Public Health Level 1: Source Control for Non-Medical Purposes Level 2: Evaluation of Alternative Mask Designs","Public Health","Source Control for Non-Medical Purposes","Evaluation of Alternative Mask Designs","Public Health Source Control for Non-Medical Purposes Evaluation of Alternative Mask Designs","Research","Science/Technology"

380,"Phytoceutical and Regenall have formed a partnership to exploit their IP (Patent and Patent applications) and clinical trial applications (CTA) in the health and medical sectors. Core to both companies IP and CTAs is vitamin A including the form retinol (where molecular size allows skin penetration) used in skin and tissue regenerative medicine. However, retinol is reactive and unstable but Phytoceutical have, including studies with the University of Surrey and NPL, demonstrated their nano-micellar delivery platform successfully stabilises and delivers retinol into skin and tissue. ,Retinol is supplied by a small number of reputable global suppliers however nano technology requires a high purity grade only available from laboratory suppliers at high prices or at lower cost and quality. There is no Pharma grade readily available at a cost effective price in the form required as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).,,Conversations have taken place with the Sri Lankan High Commission with offers to support a compact modern Pharmaceutical manufacturing plant, initially for retinol API synthesis, in a Sri Lanka Free Trade Zone. This project main focus is to build international research and innovation partnerships and networks for the technical, regulatory and commercial feasibility to set up such a facility.,,Key objectives include researching freedom to operate i.e. existing IP/patents to guide inventive synthesis approach.,,Technical: Research the feasibility with local Universities of novel retinol synthesis from local produce for a new Pharma grade.,,Regulatory: Research and conduct due diligence with the Sri Lanka medical regulator NMRA and UK regulator MHRA for facility Pharma GMP approval in Sri Lanka for API to be used in UK Pharma product manufacture for UK and EU markets with future steps to manufacture these for local and Asian markets in Sri Lanka,,Commercial: Due diligence to be conducted and meeting with potential local interested parties including State Pharmaceutical Corporation and Board of Investment. Sri Lanka needs new high tech industries and support is willing but requires interaction on the ground.,,High-tech compact facility for synthesising retinol as an API for UK manufacture and export is innovative, extending facility in future to produce nano-micellar IP protected products to Pharma GMP for Sri Lankan and Asian markets brings innovative manufacturing to the local country supporting hi value jobs and exports.

405,"Aquark Technologies is a cutting-edge start-up in quantum technologies that will radically enhance our ability to sense, measure and compute on a mass-market scale. We have created a game-changing system to capture, manipulate, and exploit the quantum characteristics of atoms by way of a low-cost, low-power module based on ultra-cold atoms. Using cold atoms as a basis for position, navigation and timing enables both a step change in performance and autonomy when compared with existing state of the art. However, the required components of cold-atom traps to-date have rendered them too complex, large and power-intensive for meaningful real-world use, and therefore limited in their application. ,Aquark has successfully overcome this major limitation by miniaturising our cold-atom engine. This miniaturisation offers us the opportunity to be first-to-market with portable, scalable quantum devices for use across sectors. Ultimately, we aim to enable mass-scale implementation of highly precise sensors and clocks, GPS-independent inertial navigation, and quantum computing, delivering against UK government priorities and urgent international need for non-GNSS alternatives as well as augmenting existing systems for increase in performance and reliability.,,Our first product and vital demonstrator for our cold-atom engine is a quantum clock, the AQlock, which will enable us to commercialise and expand rapidly into new verticals. During a previous Innovate UK-funded project, we successfully proved feasibility of this technology, including technical demonstration of an open-loop clock signal.,,This project now aims to transition the AQlock to commercial readiness, including extensive lab and live-environment testing. As part of the project, we will confirm and stress-test two supply chains (bespoke UK-based and commercial off-the-shelf, including international suppliers) to finalise a single, robust supply chain that can successfully scale manufacture of the AQlock ready for wide deployment. At all stages we will prioritise UK manufacturers and suppliers, falling back on international alternatives only when we are unable to secure necessary resources or expertise within the UK due complexity of the cold-atom engine and the AQlock.,,The AQlock is designed to integrate into existing systems as an accompaniment or augmentation to GNSS-enabled technology. Initial target sectors include telecoms, defence, finance and aviation, with committed end-users informing the scope of technical development. Delivery of the AQlock will open up quantum-enabled systems for global PNT, and simultaneously establish an underpinning UK-prioritised supply chain for quantum sensing vectors, providing the opportunity for wholesale transition away from GNSS dependency and replacing vulnerable systems with UK-grown quantum technology"," Domain: Quantum Technologies Level 1: Commercialization of Quantum Clocks Level 2: Miniaturization and Testing of Cold-Atom Engine","Quantum Technologies","Commercialization of Quantum Clocks","Miniaturization and Testing of Cold-Atom Engine","Quantum Technologies Commercialization of Quantum Clocks Miniaturization and Testing of Cold-Atom Engine",NA,NA

631,"There are millions of corneal trauma cases globally each year. Without effective treatment, ocular surface trauma can progress to long term complication and corneal blindness. Amniotic membrane has been used in ophthalmic surgery to treat disease and damage to the surface of the eye. Unfortunately clinical usage of amnion has been severely limited as it is not readily available on demand at the hospital, especially in the treatment of an emergency eye injury case. NuVision has noted this restriction and devised OmnigenTM, an immediately accessible, dry amnion-derived product that will have a much greater utility and uptake, making amnion a realistic proposition for adoption by ophthalmic surgeons into emergency medicine"," Domain: Ophthalmology Level 1: Treatment for Ocular Surface Trauma Level 2: Use of Amnion-Derived Products in Emergency Eye Injury Cases","Ophthalmology","Treatment for Ocular Surface Trauma","Use of Amnion-Derived Products in Emergency Eye Injury Cases","Ophthalmology Treatment for Ocular Surface Trauma Use of Amnion-Derived Products in Emergency Eye Injury Cases",NA,NA

411,"Two major challenges facing anyone who wishes to (re)decorate an environment are: âWhat will my room look like after I have finished redecoratingâ, and âHow will the choice of this,product for this surface impact on the choice for another surface?â. This 12 month Proof of,Concept project will develop and fully validate a novel augmented reality system to actively,engage users in the design, build and refurbishment of tiled environments. Unlike traditional,imaging techniques, High Dynamic Range (HDR) video is able to capture the full range of,lighting in a scene. This captured lighting can subsequently be used together with physically,based rendering to enable virtual objects to be placed in environments so that they not only,look realistic, but are indeed perceptually accurate. HDR video will be captured on mobile,devices using the existing on-device cameras. The structure and lighting in the scene will be,automatically extracted from this HDR video and used by a physically-based rendering system,to relight a chosen product with bespoke lighting. The resultant virtual images will be used to,augment a live view from the mobile device of the environment providing an authentic view,of the virtual products as they would appear in the area in which they are to be installed under,the userâs bespoke lighting conditions. The system will enhance customer confidence and,significantly reduce wasted time and effort in deciding on the right choice of tile for a,particular environment. The largest manufacturer and supplier of ceramic tiles in the UK,,Johnson Tiles (JT) have agreed to provide their in-depth market knowledge in the evaluation,of system as it is developed to help ensure that their customers will have high confidence that,their needs are satisfied through the augmented view before the actual (re)decoration is,finalised. Developed initially for the tiling market, the resultant system will be equally,applicable to other interior design products."," Domain: Interior Design Level 1: Augmented Reality in Decoration Level 2: Physically-Based Rendering for Virtual Placement of Products","Interior Design","Augmented Reality in Decoration","Physically-Based Rendering for Virtual Placement of Products","Interior Design Augmented Reality in Decoration Physically-Based Rendering for Virtual Placement of Products","Economy","Research and Development/E-commerce"

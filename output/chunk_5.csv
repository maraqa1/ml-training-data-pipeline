469,"This project is a collaboration between Statkraft and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). It aims to develop a methodology to measure accurately the photovoltaic (PV) power degradation rate within a large-scale solar PV power plant. ,Degradation rate is a core parameter for solar project's financial models, which are used to forecast long-term revenues, perform project valuation, etc. This key rate represents the yearly loss in capability of generating energy. In summary, it is how much your power installed capacity degrades per year.,,Historically, industry bases its rate on research institute papers and manufacturer rates. However, such rates are based on previous iterations of technologies and different operating conditions, leading to considerable uncertainty in the actual rate.,,Measuring degradation rates on operational solar PV power plants is not a trivial task. There are multiple uncertainty factors involved. In academic research, degradation rates are measured in a device-per-device basis, which is not commercially feasible at scale. In industry, a common alternative is to use long-term datasets (\>5 years) of the PV system performance collected at system or inverter (subsystem) level. However, such an approach can be problematic, as data may not be properly curated throughout time, causing significant amount of data to be filtered out, reducing the sample representativeness.,,PV systems also operate in an uncontrolled environment. It is a challenge to disentangle genuine degradation from variable weather and seasonal effects.,,This project presents a unique intersection of Metrology and Statistics challenge. On successful completion, it will provide commercial means of accurately assessing the power degradation of solar PV power plants.","Domain: Renewable Energy Level 1: Solar Power Plants Level 2: Degradation Rate MeasurementS Domain: Renewable Energy Level 1: Solar Power Plants Level 2: Accurate Measurement of PV Power Degradation Rate","Renewable Energy","Solar Power Plants","Degradation Rate MeasurementS Domain: Renewable Energy Level 1: Solar Power Plants Level 2: Accurate Measurement of PV Power Degradation Rate","Renewable Energy Solar Power Plants Degradation Rate MeasurementS Domain: Renewable Energy Level 1: Solar Power Plants Level 2: Accurate Measurement of PV Power Degradation Rate","Energy/Electricity","Research/Technology Development"

653,"This project will develop an implant to reduce pain and restore mobility to patients suffering from injuries to the cartilage in their knees. The implant is made from a novel material called FibroFix™ which is formed from a protein extracted from silk fibres called fibroin. The properties of fibroin give FibroFix™ devices unique advantages, allowing them to be very strong, smooth and resilient like cartilage itself, while also capable of regenerating new cartilage tissue. This will allow the FibroFix™ implant to be used to treat large injuries to the articular cartilage in the knee where the painful condition osteoarthritis may already be present. The project will finalise development of this implant and complete testing in animal and laboratory trials, demonstrating that it is both safe and effective. Once this has been achieved, the project will investigate the implant’s performance in a clinical trial."," Domain: Biomedical Engineering Level 1: Development of FibroFix™ Knee Implant Level 2: Clinical Trial for Osteoarthritis Treatment","Biomedical Engineering","Development of FibroFix™ Knee Implant","Clinical Trial for Osteoarthritis Treatment","Biomedical Engineering Development of FibroFix™ Knee Implant Clinical Trial for Osteoarthritis Treatment","Healthcare","Biotechnology"

494,"OptimESM will develop a novel generation of Earth system models (ESMs), combining high-resolution with an unprecedented representation of key physical and biogeochemical processes. These models will be used to deliver cutting-edge and policy-relevant knowledge around the consequences of reaching or exceeding different levels of global warming, including the risk of rapid change in key Earth system phenomena and the regional impacts arising both from the level of global warming and the occurrence of abrupt changes. OptimESM will realise these goals by bringing together four ESM groups with Integrated Assessment Modelling teams, as well as experts in model evaluation, Earth system processes, machine learning, climate impacts and science communication. OptimESM will further develop new policy-relevant emission and land use scenarios, including ones that realise the Paris Agreement, and others that temporarily or permanently overshoot the Paris Agreement targets. Using these scenarios, OptimESM will deliver long-term projections that will increase our understanding of the risk for triggering potential tipping points in phenomena such as, ice sheets, sea ice, ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, permafrost, and terrestrial ecosystems. OptimESM will further our understanding of the processes controlling such tipping points, attribute the risk of exceeding various tipping points to the level of global warming, and develop a range of techniques to forewarn the occurrence of tipping points in the real world. Artificial Intelligence (AI-) methods for statistical downscaling will be developed and applied to improve our understanding of the effect of long-term global change and tipping points on regional climate, particularly extreme events. New knowledge and data from OptimESM will be actively communicated to other disciplines, such as the impacts and policy research communities, as well as the general public. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation for actionable science-based policies."," Domain: Earth System Modeling Level 1: Development and Integration of Novel ESMs Level 2: Utilizing Advanced Techniques and Data for Tipping Point Attribution and Prediction","Earth System Modeling","Development and Integration of Novel ESMs","Utilizing Advanced Techniques and Data for Tipping Point Attribution and Prediction","Earth System Modeling Development and Integration of Novel ESMs Utilizing Advanced Techniques and Data for Tipping Point Attribution and Prediction","Research/Economy","Climate Science/Integrated Assessment Modeling/Science Communication/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning"
172,"The pandemic has challenged healthcare providers around the world as they deliver care for patients with non-COVID-19 cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. By necessity, remote consultations have rapidly replaced many in-person clinics and assessments. In parallel, patients have also quickly adopted the convenience of medical monitoring in the home as they have become skilled, activated, and empowered by self-care. ,While the pandemic has driven this rapid adoption of innovation, it has also had a significant negative impact on patients recovering from heart procedures and from hospital stays due to non-coronavirus-related respiratory episodes.,,Many in-person cardiac rehabilitation programmes and their equivalent for patients with lung disease (pulmonary rehabilitation) have closed and these services may not re-open for a considerable time. For example, the waiting times for a pulmonary rehabilitation programme after leaving hospital in some areas is now over 12 months.,,The progression of a patient along their care pathway begins before they are discharged from hospital in a process which we prefer to call \recovery\"" rather than \""rehabilitation.\"" A chain of healthcare professionals work with patients at distinct stages of recovery and"," Domain: Healthcare Level 1: Remote Healthcare Consultations and Monitoring during the Pandemic Level 2: Impact on Patient Recovery from Cardiovascular and Respiratory Conditions","Healthcare","Remote Healthcare Consultations and Monitoring during the Pandemic","Impact on Patient Recovery from Cardiovascular and Respiratory Conditions","Healthcare Remote Healthcare Consultations and Monitoring during the Pandemic Impact on Patient Recovery from Cardiovascular and Respiratory Conditions","Healthcare","Medical Technology"
279,"This project is to help GB rail embrace data and use it to improve services for passengers and cut costs. It is to kick start rail industry adoption of our innovative Trainserv software though user trials to prepare Trainserv for commercialisation and demonstrate the benefits to 8 rail organisations: Network Rail, TfL, HS2 and rail operators including LNER (London North Eastern Railway), MTR Crossrail, GWR (Great Western Railway), GTR (Govia Thameslink Railway) and ARL (Arriva Rail London). Trainserv helps rail organisations put the passenger first, improve timetables, performance, safety and save energy. How? Trainserv democratises data by integrating multiple sources real-time and converting into easy to use information to improve. Data sources include on-train data from the “blackbox” (On-train data recorder/OTDR) and Train Management System, GPS, Timetable Advisory Systems (TAS), signaling, network infrastructure, timetable and we are currently adding passengers. Users include planning, performance, control, station staff, and train crew, in particular drivers and driver managers. Trainserv is a continuous improvement tool to help measure and understand variability on the railway and help rail staff to reduce it. Variability includes train running times and station stop times, and service recovery strategies when there are delays. The trials will help us prepare and improve Trainserv for for widescale rollout and users and organisations understand how they can use the information provided by Trainserv to improve and demonstrate its value to the industry. These rail organisations want to use Trainserv to “do more for less”. Every rail organization we have approached to partner with us for this trial has said yes. They have seen the potential and want to use the trials to help the industry agree and get the December 21 timetable right, improve driving to improve safety and reduce run-time variability and understand and reduce dwell-time variability."," Domain: Transportation/ Rail Industry Level 1: Data Utilization for Rail Improvement Level 2: Implementation of Trainserv Software and User Trials","Transportation/ Rail Industry","Data Utilization for Rail Improvement","Implementation of Trainserv Software and User Trials","Transportation/ Rail Industry Data Utilization for Rail Improvement Implementation of Trainserv Software and User Trials","Transportation","Technology"

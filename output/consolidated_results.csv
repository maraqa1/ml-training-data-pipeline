617,"The production of n-butanol from fermentation of sugar using Clostridia has tremendous industrial potential (n-butanol is an important chemical intermediate for paints plastics, coatings and polymers). Butanol production via fermentation is sustainable, environmentally friendly and offers a lower cost route than chemical synthesis from oil. However, the conventional fermentation route using Clostridia suffers from low titres and volumetric productivities and a reliance on expensive (and edible) starch-based feedstocks. Commercial implementation requires novel strains with improved fermentation performance and strains capable of fermenting non-food, cellulosic feedstocks. ,Our aim is to develop advanced Clostridia strains. Specific deliverables include:-,,1)	identification and characterisation of alleles (genes) responsible for the desired tolerance traits, using genomic approaches, both in historical strains that were used commercially over four decades and in current production strains following the implementation of novel directed evolution strategies;,2)	transfer of the identified alleles into current, robust production strains, together with rational metabolic engineering to improve product titres;,3)	assessment of strain(s) performance on cellulosic feedstocks at lab and pilot scale."," Domain: Biotechnology Level 1: Sustainable Production of n-Butanol from Fermentation Level 2: Development of Advanced Clostridia Strains","Biotechnology","Sustainable Production of n-Butanol from Fermentation","Development of Advanced Clostridia Strains","Biotechnology Sustainable Production of n-Butanol from Fermentation Development of Advanced Clostridia Strains","Chemicals","Biotechnology/Environmental Science"

551,"The world is currently undergoing a strategic energy transition. Huge amounts of capital are being committed to renewable energy technologies in the way of debt funding, Venture Capital and Private Equity investment as well as insurance premiums and pension fund investments. ,Whilst financial market actors chase lucrative opportunities, the risks are also high. In particular, the potential for variability in asset performance presents significant challenges for those planning pricing strategies, pricing financial risk, monitoring financial exposures or assessing the attractiveness of potential future investments. Sound electricity market modelling is thus of significant value for financial services as well as energy operators.,,A common requirement is the need to understand how assets, or portfolios of assets, will perform over different future timeframes. The BELIEVE project will provide improved strategic insight on the future operational and financial performance of electricity generation assets across a range of business-relevant timeframes. We will do this through an enhanced capability to model future returns from generation assets ('economic dispatch').,,In the context of the BELIEVE project, 'economic dispatch' means the modelling of the market dynamics of energy systems. This capability is required by financial services organisations to explore the future revenue generation potential, and hence the valuation of, individual assets or portfolios of assets. This insight is required over a range of timeframes from months to decades. This contrasts with 'operational dispatch', which is about hourly or sub-hourly decision-making and is primarily the concern of asset operators.,,The current state of the art in economic dispatch tends to neglect the challenges posed by the increased penetration of variable renewable energy (primarily wind and solar). Through the BELIEVE project our aim is to enrich traditional economic dispatch modelling by incorporating the effects of weather variability, in both the present and future climates. We will demonstrate the utility of this enhanced modelling capability in markets with increasing proportions of variable renewable generation.,,The result will be a highly innovative and powerful modelling capability that represents a more comprehensive methodology for asset valuations, with the potential to provide significant additional insight for financial services actors.,,BELIEVE will be led by the Institute for Environmental Analytics, a leading centre for applied weather and climate analytics at the University of Reading."," Domain: Energy Transition Level 1: Strategic Energy Transition Level 2: Economic Dispatch Modelling for Renewable Energy Markets","Energy Transition","Strategic Energy Transition","Economic Dispatch Modelling for Renewable Energy Markets","Energy Transition Strategic Energy Transition Economic Dispatch Modelling for Renewable Energy Markets","Finance/Financial Services","Energy/Energy Technology"

542,"One of the key barriers to the more widespread adoption of high performance carbon fibre-reinforced polymer composites in the automotive sector is the difficulty in achieving the required short cycle time, high volume production to satisfy the requirements of mainstream applications. With thermosetting-based composite systems this is particularly challenging because of their reliance on a definite cure schedule. Thermoplastic-based systems on the other hand, which can be reversibly heated, formed and cooled, offer more flexibility in this respect. Therefore, the objective of the proposed project is to develop a short cycle time, high volume manufacturing process for carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic components. The vision is to develop production technologies for the rapid “stamp-forming” of CFRP parts in a fashion that is somewhat analogous to the stamping of sheet metals. In addition to providing the automotive sector with a viable processing route for high performance composite components, the technology should also be transferable to medium volume aerospace parts."," Domain: Manufacturing Level 1: High Performance Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymer Composites Level 2: Short Cycle Time, High Volume Manufacturing Process for Thermoplastic Components","Manufacturing","High Performance Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymer Composites","Short Cycle Time, High Volume Manufacturing Process for Thermoplastic Components","Manufacturing High Performance Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymer Composites Short Cycle Time, High Volume Manufacturing Process for Thermoplastic Components","Manufacturing","Automotive/Aerospace"

261,"Almost 460,000 people a year are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer across the world, with the number of cases predicted to rise by 6% over the coming decades due to a plateau in research developments and therapeutic advancements. Unfortunately, due to non-specific symptoms which often present late, and the current sub-optimal diagnostic tests for pancreatic cancer, it is often only diagnosed in the later stages of the disease, and usually when it has already spread to secondary locations. The survival statistics are alarming, with less than 30% of patients suitable candidates for receiving any surgery or treatment after diagnosis and over 75% of patients do not survive for more than a year. ,The current blood test for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is wholly inadequate, being only raised in ~50% of cases, also raised in a plethora of other benign unrelated conditions, or does not detect the cancer until late in the disease progression. Furthermore, there is currently no screening tool for people who are at high risk of developing pancreatic cancer.,,GenoME builds on its success with OvaME, a blood test for early detection of ovarian cancer. We are now aiming to develop a simple blood test which detects specific modifications of DNA (DNA methylation) which are present in the early stages of pancreatic cancer. Our candidate DNAme markers display potential superior accuracy and reliability over the current pancreatic cancer blood test, potentially improving the survival and quality of life of those affected. Whilst this test, PanME, will initially be launched as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic individuals, the long-term ambition for GenoME is to market the test as the world's first screening tool for pancreatic cancer.

Innovate UK will play an integral role in the forthcoming UK National Innovation Plan having responsibility to de-risk, enable and support innovation within the UK. To meet this responsibility, a key objective for Innovate UK is to maximise the benefit of innovation for the UK economy into the next decade. This requires Innovate UK to undertsand the economic impact of their funding and to control their budget well so as to avoid missed opportunities. Having invested around £1.8 billion in innovation since 2007, Innovate UK has a need to understand the economic impact of their investments to ensure the quality of future investments. Ten years' worth of investments means that data is available to analyse not only short-term effects of funding, but also mid- and longer-term impacts, such as company growth indicators. Application of machine learning to this data will provide insights into economic exploitation and help inform future decisions. Innovate UK is tasked with not over-spending, but also not under-spending by more than 1%, against allocated core budget, which leaves little margin for error in the spend targets and budget control. However, grant recipient expenditure claim forecasts are not typically accurate to within the 1% variance, but rather around 10%. A 10% underspend across numerous projects results in substantial missed opportunities. For example a 10% error across the core budget of £550 million would be £55.0 million, an amount that could have funded additional innovation projects. With no expected improvement in current forecasts, this problem needs an innovative solution to help tackle it. Using our data platform, Analytics Engines XDP™, we will bring together data and systems from across Innovate UK, third parties and open data, creating a single view of all the information available. Then using inbuilt advanced analytics capabilities, we will apply machine learning and predictive models to aid in tackling these problems. The purpose of the project is to develop a tool that will automatically provide Innovate UK with real-time monitoring information about their investments and costs. We will also build predictive models based on recipient forecasts, historical data, business/organisation data and other data to predict actual costs and economic impact of investments. This will allow Innovate UK to make more informed investment decisions and to take action to minimise underspend. The tool will be based on proven machine learning techniques using large volumes of data to identify patterns and categorise events from disparate data sets, becoming more accurate and efficient as the models are trained and the data available increases."," Domain: Government Funded Investments Level 1: Maximizing Economic Impact Level 2: Utilizing Machine Learning to Improve Investment Decisions and Control Budgets.

69,"RevoNA is an emerging spin-out from the University of Portsmouth (UoP) that aims to revolutionise the discovery of new drugs targeting ribonucleic acids (RNAs). It has been known for some time that RNA is the key mechanism by which information in DNA (the blueprint of life) is used to create proteins (the building blocks of life), but the full importance of RNA in regulating the biological processes of life has only recently been revealed. Over 100,000 RNAs have now been identified in the body and it is recognised that targeting RNAs with drugs has the potential to treat both viral and bacterial infections, as well as offering new hope across a rapidly increasing range of diseases, including cancer, cardiac dysfunction, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. While RNA drugs are undoubtedly at the leading edge of pharmaceutical innovation, whether they ultimately play a key role in reducing the global burden of disease is dependent on increasing the pace and breadth of RNA research and development. This will only be achieved if the significant limitations to screening RNA target/drug interactions can be addressed, as existing methods are either slow, costly and labour intensive, or fast, but provide minimal information. ,RevoNA has demonstrated and patented a technology which enables the fast, effective and low-cost screening of RNA target-drug interactions. This project focuses on exploiting our proven technology to launch a company delivering RNA screening service partnerships to RNA therapeutic research and development (R&D) organisations. This project will deliver quality assurance technical data packs and case studies which are important precursors to business development, further investment and sustainable commercial success as they will demonstrate the superiority and benefits of our technology over the limited existing approaches.,,Our research was ahead of its time, but our market engagement shows the rapidly growing RNA drug sector would hugely benefit from our technology now. Public investment will enable the UK to be at the forefront of a new market in RNA screening partnerships which will capitalise on the rapidly expanding field of RNA drug development. This is particularly topical as COVID-19 has prompted public interest in RNA more generally. With the weight of RNA drug development currently occurring in the US, RevoNA offers a step-change in capability and potential for the UK to access this market and by unlocking UK RNA drug development, provide an opportunity to increase the UK's role in addressing the global burden of disease."," Domain: Pharmaceutical Industry Level 1: RNA Drug Development Level 2: Rapid and Affordable RNA Target-Drug Interaction Screening","Pharmaceutical Industry","RNA Drug Development","Rapid and Affordable RNA Target-Drug Interaction Screening","Pharmaceutical Industry RNA Drug Development Rapid and Affordable RNA Target-Drug Interaction Screening","Research and Development","Pharmaceutical Industry"
435,"The in-pond harsh environment closed loop variable buoyancy lifting device relies on the Archimedes principle. Archimedes principle states that a body partially or completely immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body. By changing the volume of displaced fluid, the device creates a variable lifting force. The novel application is to use a closed loop in which the inflation air is stored under pressure in a receiver. This compressed air inflates the variable displacement to provide lift. To submerge the air is transferred back into the receiver via a compressor and a series of control valves. The small observation class ROV systems currently being operated on the Sellafield site will be able to manoeuvre the suspended load. This can be most clearly demonstrated how historically during the era of canal transportation a horse could easily pull a fully laden 100 ton barge along a canal.","Domain: Marine Technology Level 1: Underwater Vehicles Level 2: Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices Domain: Marine Technology Level 1: Underwater Vehicles Level 2: Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices","Marine Technology","Underwater Vehicles","Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices Domain: Marine Technology Level 1: Underwater Vehicles Level 2: Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices","Marine Technology Underwater Vehicles Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices Domain: Marine Technology Level 1: Underwater Vehicles Level 2: Novel Closed-loop Lifting Devices","Transport","Water Transportation"

405,"Aquark Technologies is a cutting-edge start-up in quantum technologies that will radically enhance our ability to sense, measure and compute on a mass-market scale. We have created a game-changing system to capture, manipulate, and exploit the quantum characteristics of atoms by way of a low-cost, low-power module based on ultra-cold atoms. Using cold atoms as a basis for position, navigation and timing enables both a step change in performance and autonomy when compared with existing state of the art. However, the required components of cold-atom traps to-date have rendered them too complex, large and power-intensive for meaningful real-world use, and therefore limited in their application. ,Aquark has successfully overcome this major limitation by miniaturising our cold-atom engine. This miniaturisation offers us the opportunity to be first-to-market with portable, scalable quantum devices for use across sectors. Ultimately, we aim to enable mass-scale implementation of highly precise sensors and clocks, GPS-independent inertial navigation, and quantum computing, delivering against UK government priorities and urgent international need for non-GNSS alternatives as well as augmenting existing systems for increase in performance and reliability.,,Our first product and vital demonstrator for our cold-atom engine is a quantum clock, the AQlock, which will enable us to commercialise and expand rapidly into new verticals. During a previous Innovate UK-funded project, we successfully proved feasibility of this technology, including technical demonstration of an open-loop clock signal.,,This project now aims to transition the AQlock to commercial readiness, including extensive lab and live-environment testing. As part of the project, we will confirm and stress-test two supply chains (bespoke UK-based and commercial off-the-shelf, including international suppliers) to finalise a single, robust supply chain that can successfully scale manufacture of the AQlock ready for wide deployment. At all stages we will prioritise UK manufacturers and suppliers, falling back on international alternatives only when we are unable to secure necessary resources or expertise within the UK due complexity of the cold-atom engine and the AQlock.,,The AQlock is designed to integrate into existing systems as an accompaniment or augmentation to GNSS-enabled technology. Initial target sectors include telecoms, defence, finance and aviation, with committed end-users informing the scope of technical development. Delivery of the AQlock will open up quantum-enabled systems for global PNT, and simultaneously establish an underpinning UK-prioritised supply chain for quantum sensing vectors, providing the opportunity for wholesale transition away from GNSS dependency and replacing vulnerable systems with UK-grown quantum technology"," Domain: Quantum Technologies Level 1: Commercialization of Quantum Clocks Level 2: Miniaturization and Testing of Cold-Atom Engine","Quantum Technologies","Commercialization of Quantum Clocks","Miniaturization and Testing of Cold-Atom Engine","Quantum Technologies Commercialization of Quantum Clocks Miniaturization and Testing of Cold-Atom Engine",NA,NA

NML's vision is to undertake fundamental innovation in the mechanical sector, enabling lightweight and efficient mechanised motion. Initially spun-out from University College London and steered by the Deep Science Ventures Accelerator programme (which provided both guidance on the value proposition and initial pre-seed investment that has been used to manufacture the Proof of Concept). ,**World Changing Drive Technology**,,NML's innovation is the biggest breakthrough in power transmission technology since the invention of the roller-chain first observed in drawings by Leonardo Da Vinci more than 500 years ago. With current chain technology, over 60% of the transmitted power is acting on only one tooth and chain link at any one time, leading to high mechanical wear and is the reason why expensive metals are required for both chains and sprockets.,,NML's chain dramatically reduces wear by sharing the transmitted force over all of the teeth on the sprocket at the same time, this leads to an ~86% reduction in peak stress compared to a conventional roller-chain, enabling a 10 times increase in sprocket lifespan and 3 times increase chain lifespan. Mechanical wear does not have to be a primary consideration anymore; meaning that different materials such as self-lubricating plastics and carbon fibre with additional benefits such as hygiene, cost and weight reductions can be used in chain and transmission design."," Domain: Mechanical Engineering Level 1: Innovative Power Transmission Technology Level 2: Reducing Wear and Increasing Lifespan of Chains and Sprockets","Mechanical Engineering","Innovative Power Transmission Technology","Reducing Wear and Increasing Lifespan of Chains and Sprockets","Mechanical Engineering Innovative Power Transmission Technology Reducing Wear and Increasing Lifespan of Chains and Sprockets","Mechanical/Engineering","Research and Development/Manufacturing"

If efficacy can be established, this form of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) will be a new tool for enhancing social distancing and helping to get people back to work in a safe way. We will reframe the requirements analysis for source control PPE, validate emerging approaches, and assess various materials and design approaches. ,The goal is to assess a new type of mask (face gaiter) and compare it to existing masks for suitability as source control for non-medical purposes, to meet government guidelines and the physical requirements of extended work hours, job duties, and related social interaction. The face gaiter resembles existing sport face coverings but is engineered specifically for source control. It is also durable, machine washable and can be reused hundreds of times.,,One objective is to modernise the tools for source control; currently there is a reliance on masks designed for medical or hazardous materials environments, which may or may not be suitable for use by the general public over extended periods of time. Another objective is to help evolve reviews of source control options towards UK and international rating systems.,,The project addresses a long-standing need surfaced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Source control has been used to reduce the transmission rate of bacteria and viruses, such as when sick patients present to hospital. Surgical masks may be issued for source control to a symptomatic patient and to those accompanying the patient to account for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. A key deficiency in such masks is the quality of the seal where the mask meets the face: the masks are poor-fitting; do not accommodate facial hair; lay in close proximity to the mouth; and have low breathability. Taken together, expelled air can escape around the sides of the mask and reduce the effectiveness of this type of source control. All of these issues are addressed by the novel design of the face gaiter.,,When surgical masks are in short supply then a reusable alternative is advantageous. A source control tool suitable for extended use and re-use is timely due to the COVID-19 outbreak and it can support the Government's recovery from the pandemic by limiting the transmission of infection, e.g. in the delivery of essential services and more generally once restrictions on movement start to lift.,,The proof of concept for a novel source control mask conducted under the original project was successful.  The research team designed, tested, and manufactured a re-usable face covering that lets a wearer safely breathe whilst containing potential hazards and minimising leakage.  Under the extension, the research team will carry out tests focused on the protection provided to the wearer by this novel type of face mask.   These tests will evaluate the performance of the mask to protect the wearer from small aerosols within the environment. The test will be carried out on full masks fitted on a breathing mannequin to capture the total performance of the solution. Testing of FFP2 masks, surgical masks, traditional neck gaiters and new “half-face” cloth masks will provide useful comparisons and help reinforce the benefits of this novel design.  Tests for extended durability will be conducted to determine performance after many wash-and-tumble-dry cycles.  A summary of the project’s extensive knowledgebase will then be created to support efforts to standardise the design parameters for non-medical face coverings."," Domain: Public Health Level 1: Source Control for Non-Medical Purposes Level 2: Evaluation of Alternative Mask Designs","Public Health","Source Control for Non-Medical Purposes","Evaluation of Alternative Mask Designs","Public Health Source Control for Non-Medical Purposes Evaluation of Alternative Mask Designs","Research","Science/Technology"

469,"This project is a collaboration between Statkraft and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). It aims to develop a methodology to measure accurately the photovoltaic (PV) power degradation rate within a large-scale solar PV power plant. ,Degradation rate is a core parameter for solar project's financial models, which are used to forecast long-term revenues, perform project valuation, etc. This key rate represents the yearly loss in capability of generating energy. In summary, it is how much your power installed capacity degrades per year.,,Historically, industry bases its rate on research institute papers and manufacturer rates. However, such rates are based on previous iterations of technologies and different operating conditions, leading to considerable uncertainty in the actual rate.,,Measuring degradation rates on operational solar PV power plants is not a trivial task. There are multiple uncertainty factors involved. In academic research, degradation rates are measured in a device-per-device basis, which is not commercially feasible at scale. In industry, a common alternative is to use long-term datasets (\>5 years) of the PV system performance collected at system or inverter (subsystem) level. However, such an approach can be problematic, as data may not be properly curated throughout time, causing significant amount of data to be filtered out, reducing the sample representativeness.,,PV systems also operate in an uncontrolled environment. It is a challenge to disentangle genuine degradation from variable weather and seasonal effects.,,This project presents a unique intersection of Metrology and Statistics challenge.

494,"OptimESM will develop a novel generation of Earth system models (ESMs), combining high-resolution with an unprecedented representation of key physical and biogeochemical processes. These models will be used to deliver cutting-edge and policy-relevant knowledge around the consequences of reaching or exceeding different levels of global warming, including the risk of rapid change in key Earth system phenomena and the regional impacts arising both from the level of global warming and the occurrence of abrupt changes. OptimESM will realise these goals by bringing together four ESM groups with Integrated Assessment Modelling teams, as well as experts in model evaluation, Earth system processes, machine learning, climate impacts and science communication. OptimESM will further develop new policy-relevant emission and land use scenarios, including ones that realise the Paris Agreement, and others that temporarily or permanently overshoot the Paris Agreement targets. Using these scenarios, OptimESM will deliver long-term projections that will increase our understanding of the risk for triggering potential tipping points in phenomena such as, ice sheets, sea ice, ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, permafrost, and terrestrial ecosystems. OptimESM will further our understanding of the processes controlling such tipping points, attribute the risk of exceeding various tipping points to the level of global warming, and develop a range of techniques to forewarn the occurrence of tipping points in the real world. Artificial Intelligence (AI-) methods for statistical downscaling will be developed and applied to improve our understanding of the effect of long-term global change and tipping points on regional climate, particularly extreme events. New knowledge and data from OptimESM will be actively communicated to other disciplines, such as the impacts and policy research communities, as well as the general public.

279,"This project is to help GB rail embrace data and use it to improve services for passengers and cut costs. It is to kick start rail industry adoption of our innovative Trainserv software though user trials to prepare Trainserv for commercialisation and demonstrate the benefits to 8 rail organisations: Network Rail, TfL, HS2 and rail operators including LNER (London North Eastern Railway), MTR Crossrail, GWR (Great Western Railway), GTR (Govia Thameslink Railway) and ARL (Arriva Rail London). Trainserv helps rail organisations put the passenger first, improve timetables, performance, safety and save energy. How? Trainserv democratises data by integrating multiple sources real-time and converting into easy to use information to improve. Data sources include on-train data from the “blackbox” (On-train data recorder/OTDR) and Train Management System, GPS, Timetable Advisory Systems (TAS), signaling, network infrastructure, timetable and we are currently adding passengers. Users include planning, performance, control, station staff, and train crew, in particular drivers and driver managers. Trainserv is a continuous improvement tool to help measure and understand variability on the railway and help rail staff to reduce it. Variability includes train running times and station stop times, and service recovery strategies when there are delays. The trials will help us prepare and improve Trainserv for for widescale rollout and users and organisations understand how they can use the information provided by Trainserv to improve and demonstrate its value to the industry. These rail organisations want to use Trainserv to “do more for less”. Every rail organization we have approached to partner with us for this trial has said yes. They have seen the potential and want to use the trials to help the industry agree and get the December 21 timetable right, improve driving to improve safety and reduce run-time variability and understand and reduce dwell-time variability."," Domain: Transportation/ Rail Industry Level 1: Data Utilization for Rail Improvement Level 2: Implementation of Trainserv Software and User Trials","Transportation/ Rail Industry","Data Utilization for Rail Improvement","Implementation of Trainserv Software and User Trials","Transportation/ Rail Industry Data Utilization for Rail Improvement Implementation of Trainserv Software and User Trials","Transportation","Technology"

175,"The overall objective of the project is to perfect a system for encapsulating a wood veneer into a glass fibre moulding for the application of racing boats. Many boat owners desire boats that have an aesthetically pleasing authentic wooden finish, which are still suitable for racing. However, in the recent years wooden boats sales have fallen due to their significant expense and slow production time due to the labour intensive building methods used, and time consuming and expensive annual maintenance of finishing the boats. There is a business opportunity for us to offer a Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) protected, infused wood veneer boat, which would have the benefits of a modern GRP manufactured process combined with the traditional look of a wooden finish. The advantages to the boat purchaser include a great looking “wooden” boat which is attractive to the traditional buyers at a competitive price with lower maintenance costs. It would also help open up the market to non-competitive sailors. The return on investment for this Experimental Development project cost is 200% over 5 years, helping grow our sales 50% above current levels and maintaining or even increasing our current level of exports from 80% by year 5 post commercialisation."," Domain: Maritime Technology Level 1: Wood Veneer and Glass Fibre Composite Boats Level 2: Development of GRP Infused Wood Veneer Boats for Racing Applications","Maritime Technology","Wood Veneer and Glass Fibre Composite Boats","Development of GRP Infused Wood Veneer Boats for Racing Applications","Maritime Technology Wood Veneer and Glass Fibre Composite Boats Development of GRP Infused Wood Veneer Boats for Racing Applications","Manufacturing","Shipbuilding/Boatbuilding"

Working with customers on a direct basis or via selected broking partners, we cater to micro, small and medium businesses.,,With Aurora, customers can get personalised, real-time quotations, compare insurance providers and transfer and mitigate risk in a uniquely tailor-made way. All while benefiting from analytics and data driven education and advice.,,Issue/demand: Aurora have been approached by the insurance industry and SMEs to resolve a continuing unmet/unresolved market need. Traditionally insurers sell off-the-shelf package products with coverages that a customer may not need, as well as coverages missing that they do need. This may be due to some insurers only offering types of covers or insurance within specific segments or may be an amalgamation of the cheapest insurance quote by cover. Also, it is acknowledged by insurers that these policies have evolved incrementally, resulting in very large, hard to read/inconsistent documents with conflicting wording and policy limits.,,Solution: To develop Aurora's Algorithmic Trading (AT-AURORA) - an innovative digital trading product to meet market need by delivering uniquely tailor personalised packages of insurance cover online in 15mins (instead of industry standard of 4/5 weeks) with each cover priced individually and amalgamated in real-time into an appropriate, single, coherent (understandable) insurance package.

207,"CherSoft are a leading supplier of charts and navigation technology to maritime users. Over the last three years we have developed the concept of the Universal Chart Server (UCS). This,is in response to a unique market opportunity, arising from future requirements for,commercial vessels in terms of electronic chart supply. These require commercial vessels to,carry Electronic Chart and Display Systems (ECDIS) from 2017. Up to date Electronic,Navigation Chart (ENC) data is essential and a legal requirement for their correct use.,Authorities may impound vessels without updated charts and impose fines of $50,000 a day,on the owners. Operators also lose precious ‘slots’ in at-capacity shipping lanes. Our,commercial experience has taught us that maritime shipping is slow to adopt internet,technology. Intuitively, this is due to the high cost of satellite connectivity, which is the only,practical mechanism for offshore vessels to access the internet. Furthermore, vessels incur,large fees associated with the necessary data subscription tariffs. Data transfer via satellites,typically costs several $ a minute via a data subscription, or costing vessels $9,500 per year on,an annual tariff.,We propose meeting these badly met market needs by developing a universal chart integration,and display system that integrates all 15,000 charts from all major global providers in a single,coherent form. We will deliver an innovative step change through new compression and,decompression technology that will reduce the bandwidth requirements for satellite ENC,updating. We will make ENC update leaner still, by targeting only essential and relevant,information. Our target is a 50% reduction in total data transferred per update.

It's important for a number of reasons ,* Mental Health trust CEOs expect COVID-19 to induce a significant surge in demand but services have been running close to 100% capacity during the lockdown due to the adoption of telehealth but there's no surplus capacity,* Current vacancy rates for medial personnel in the NHS mental trusts runs at 12.4%, double that for the rest of the NHS exacerbating the situation,* Less than 2m of the 12m a year in the UK with a diagnosable mental health condition get professional help which translates to a estimated cost to the UK of £100Bn (Chief medical officer NHS 2014),,Therapists currently spend 1½ -2 hours a day writing up their notes. Automating the generation of a summary immediately at the end of a session could save an hour a day. The therapist just needs to add their therapeutic notes to the automated summary rather than recall the full session.,,The time saved could allow therapists to offer at least 1 extra session a day which would be a 20% boost in productivity for the NHS. Other benefits are the notes would be more consistent across sessions as unlike therapists, computers are more consistent than humans at boring tasks. They're not subject to the problems of poor human recall, cognitive bias and noise in human decision making. Our technology addresses the problems of privacy and confidentiality by giving control to the people in the room and not some remote cloud based solution with vulnerabilities to hackers. One of the more exciting possibilities is there may be therapeutic effects but that needs to be explored in a subsequent project.,,This project is about extending the technology we have already developed and finding partners in the therapist community to collaborate with to test our assumptions and produce an experimental prototype and a project plan that could provide the basis for a custom designed device to provide a platform for mental health therapists and patients.

665,"This application is focused on the development of novel ways of understanding who might be at risk of having psychotic disorders. Psychosis is a highly challenging mental health condition and will typically result in the individual suffering from hallucinations and delusions. Psychotic episodes can be incredibly dangerous and lead to life changing trauma and fatalities. The condition is a huge burden on the individual, their family, loved ones and the healthcare system. The only way of spotting the warning signs of psychosis today is via direct consultation with a healthcare professional. Consequently, there are many in our society with undiagnosed early-stage psychosis, which poses significant risks to both themselves and those around them. ,The applicants, presenting this application, are leading researchers in the use of digital technologies for the detection of psychosis. In simple terms, this team is developing a set of intuitive tasks that prompt one to speak into a mobile phone and record one's speech patterns. Their initial research has shown that it is then, in principle, possible for software to analyse these spoken responses and determine whether an individual has low, medium or high risk of psychosis. The ultimate goal is to develop a simple and low cost application that can be prescribed to patients to quickly evaluate their risk of psychosis. This would enable high risk individuals to be identified for relevant medical intervention.,,This team of researchers has started a company to develop this software. The vital next step in the development is to conduct a feasibility study to determine if their software prototype is able to discriminate between healthy and higher risk persons from a group of volunteer users. The enclosed application is focused on a programme of R&D to test and refine the diagnostic performance of the software.,,If the team is able to successfully demonstrate that the software works in principle, they will be in a far better position to gain support from clinicians and investors. They will be able to secure the support they need to conduct the formal clinical studies needed to demonstrate the benefits of the solution and its value to healthcare providers.","Domain: Mental Health Level 1: Psychosis Level 2: Early Detection and Diagnosis Domain: Mental Health Level 1: Psychosis Level 2: Digital Technology for Detection","Mental Health","Psychosis","Early Detection and Diagnosis Domain: Mental Health Level 1: Psychosis Level 2: Digital Technology for Detection","Mental Health Psychosis Early Detection and Diagnosis Domain: Mental Health Level 1: Psychosis Level 2: Digital Technology for Detection",NA,NA

Existing solar roof tiles have been limited in their application as compatible,with only a subset of the wide range of roof tiles on the market.,Universality requires the development of a set of robust and cost effective interfaces between,the photovoltaic (PV) tile and the remainder of the roof, including ridges, verges, gutters and a,wide set of geometries. The opportunity is to create the solar equivalent of a Velux window –,universal in its application, cost competitive with traditional solutions and aesthetically,appealing. Fundamentally, it should perform the weatherproofing function of a roof, but also,generate electricity.,The bulk of today’s PV products use a limited palette of materials – notably aluminium and,glass – to create the physical package. This proof of concept will explore a wider set of,materials and manufacturing processes as avenues to potential cost reductions to the non “PVcell”,elements of the system. These investigations and the design should enable ongoing cost,reduction (see appended GTM graph).,Solar cell costs continue to fall so the portion of the final installed cost for a PV system which,relates to mounting structure and installation costs is becoming more important. A universal,solar roof tile will help to reduce the installed cost for PV by utilising existing construction,skills, namely roofers, and removing the need for a costly support structure by using the,building itself as support.,Lowering the overall costs of ownership for a universal PV product means that the number of,roofs which can be used for solar generation will increase.

A,significant increase in biogas productivity will radically change the economics of small,Anaerobic Digesters and realise an unfulfilled need for Single Farm AD plants and cost,effective sewage processing by Water Companies. Research strongly indicates that a very,significant increase in biogas productivity can be achieved. A payback period for most,feedstocks of the order of 5 years or less is predicted, significantly less for higher energy,feedstocks.,AD takes place primarily in 2 phases: Hydrolysis during which the feedstock is broken down,into simpler soluble organic compounds and Methanogenesis during which the hydrolysed,feedstock is decomposed and synthesised to produce biogas. Recent laboratory research,indicates that significant improvements can be made in the performance of Hydrolysis in,small reactors on a range of feedstocks through the use of thermal, mechanical and enzyme,pre-treatments. The potential gain in performance arise from operation at lower temperatures,leading to lower plant operating costs and at higher rates leading to reduced reactor size and,reduced capital costs.

459,"**Challenge:**Rice is a staple for nearly half of the world's 7 billion population and is mainly produced in south-east Asia (Mohanty\_2013). As the global population rises, to over nine billion by 2030, there will be huge pressure on land for food -- and rice yields must increase by 25% (Fernandez\_and\_Orth\_2018). However, rice yields are decreasing due to climate change (Zhao\_et\_al\_2017). In addition, rice cultivation accounts for 12% of global methane emissions (World\_Economics\_Forum\_2019), which is 30-times more a potent Green House Gas, than CO2 (National\_Geographic). Today, global rice production is doing as much harm as 1,200 average-sized coal power stations, and by 2030, will be responsible for 6% of total GHG emissions (We\_Forum\_2019). Despite sustained initiatives particularly in China, Japan, Korea and at the International Rice Research institute (IRRI) in the Philippines, established approaches are unable to produce high enough yields, and have effectively plateaued in China, Indonesia, Japan and Korea, and although rising linearly in some key countries such as India and Vietnam, the rates of increase are too slow to meet demand (Grassini\_and\_Cassman\_2013). ,**Solution:** This 24-month industrial research project between NIAB and Tropic advances the state-of-the-art in a plant product (rice) and it's production system (gene editing to increase rice yield), creating a unique UK technology and product export opportunity, and significantly contributes to Net Zero (reducing emissions from rice cultivation), demonstrated through glasshouse trials initially with field performance confirmation latterly (TRL7). We have already demonstrated that we can gene edit favourable traits into a variety of crops (e.g., disease resistant bananas and rice). We will use our previous know-how to build this novel production system, including technical work, utilising Knock-Down and Knock-Out gene editing to modify yield-related regions of interest in rice and select the best rice lines. By the end of this project, we will be in a position then utilise our patented 'GEiGS' technology to create non-GMO rice in several rice varieties, which we will then commercialise. Impact: Increasing rice yield, has the potential to massively cut GHG emissions, whilst producing more grain, and thus keeping the land-mass utilised constant. We have predicted that higher yielding rice could lead to a total CO2 reduction for rain-fed rice of 730 Kg CO2/ha, and for irrigated rice 1330 Kg CO2/ha.,,**_If everyone globally were to consume Tropic's rice, this could equate to savings of 433 million tonnes of CO2 annually_.**"," Domain: Agriculture Level 1: Increasing Rice Yields Level 2: Gene Editing for Yield-related Traits in Rice","Agriculture","Increasing Rice Yields","Gene Editing for Yield-related Traits in Rice","Agriculture Increasing Rice Yields Gene Editing for Yield-related Traits in Rice","Agriculture","Research and Development"

519,"Over 4m people annually in the UK are affected by pain and immobility caused by a deficient meniscus, costing the equivalent of 1% GNP (NHS Business Plan 2017). The problem goes beyond age-related degenerative diseases and includes accidents/sports injuries in patients of any age. ,Technological challenges in developing load-bearing materials with suitable surface characteristics for such soft-tissue orthopaedic applications restrict options for treatment. In the absence of replacement devices, the standard of care for an irreparable meniscus is partial or complete removal (meniscectomy), with 2million/year such procedures world-wide (Li 2020).,,In response Orthonika, an SME spin-out from Imperial College London, has developed novel, reinforced load bearing PVA-PEG hydrogel materials for use in meniscus replacement. These unique materials are incorporated into an implant fixed directly to the bone via a reliable and established method.,,Hydrogels have long been thought of as highly promising materials for soft tissue replacements, potentially opening up new markets for orthopaedic implants. Their adoption has been hampered by poor mechanical properties and low fracture toughness. Laboratory tests have shown that Orthonika's PVA-PEG materials have exceptional mechanical and tribological properties that closely mimic those of natural tissue and are superior to the standard crosslinked PVA hydrogels currently in use for other applications.,,Building on previous work, Orthonika must now address technical challenges in product development to demonstrate GMP manufacturability for clinical-scale production and subsequent validation in ovine studies, targeting readiness for first-in-human clinical studies post-project.,,The project enables Orthonika to:,,* Manufacture at clinical-scale, bridging to development for commercial manufacturing post-clinical validation and,* Validate the TMR implant in ovine studies and therefore accelerate translation to human.,,This represents significant progression towards commercialisation/clinical uptake:,,* New surgical options for patients (alternatives to meniscectomy/TKR),* Enhanced healthcare capabilities (alignment with key performance indicators such as wait times and patient recovery),* Servicing a £1bn+ global market,* Potential adaptation to target other load-bearing orthopaedic applications (cartilage, intervertebral discs)."," Domain: Medical Technology Level 1: Innovative Meniscus Replacement Techniques Level 2: Development and Validation of PVA-PEG Hydrogel Implants for Ovine Studies","Medical Technology","Innovative Meniscus Replacement Techniques","Development and Validation of PVA-PEG Hydrogel Implants for Ovine Studies","Medical Technology Innovative Meniscus Replacement Techniques Development and Validation of PVA-PEG Hydrogel Implants for Ovine Studies","Healthcare","Orthopaedics/Technology"

87,"Nearly all of us have taken antibiotics: they really are a 'wonder drug' saving millions of lives every year, by specifically killing bacteria. They are rapidly becoming less effective as bacteria develop ways to resist them. An example of this is the spread of MRSA in hospitals. A recent review (The O'Neill Report) conducted by the UK government with the Wellcome Trust concluded that by 2050 antibiotic resistant infections would kill more people each year than cancer, and many common medical procedures such as hip replacements or Caesarean sections will become too dangerous to perform. New antibiotics are badly needed, and soil organisms have been one of the best sources of antibiotics over the last 70 years. However, soil organisms may only make an antibiotic under certain conditions which are hard to copy outside of their natural environment, which makes identification and exploitation difficult. Bactevo have isolated hundreds of organisms from the soil and hard-wired them to make all the chemicals they can make, including antibiotics, all the time. We then screen them for their ability to kill dangerous bacteria. The work is now progressing to advance these chemicals through to the creation of novel, effective antibiotics, ensuring future generations will have access to these vital drugs."," Domain: Medicine Level 1: Antibiotic resistance Level 2: Development of novel antibiotics from soil organisms","Medicine","Antibiotic resistance","Development of novel antibiotics from soil organisms","Medicine Antibiotic resistance Development of novel antibiotics from soil organisms","Biotechnology","Pharmaceutical Manufacturing"

530,"With the UK government's mandate to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, together with the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, there is no doubt that the battery market is going to experience rapid growth over the next 10 years. Solid-state batteries are a key technology to augment and replace current lithium-ion technology due to their increased safety and potential to achieve greater energy/power densities. ,Project partners, Lucideon, KWSP and Loughborough University will assess two complementary technologies, Additive Manufacturing (AM) and contactless Field Enhanced Sintering (c-Flash) to manufacture thin, textured/designed films of solid electrolytes for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. This new method of manufacturing addresses three of the main technological challenges with solid-state batteries: thin film processing, increasing electrolyte/electrode interfacial area and minimising ion volatilisation. This project will simultaneously target benefits in resource and energy efficiency, assessing the possibility of combining two novel and highly efficient technologies to exploit the strengths of both systems. The processes and pilot scale manufacturing will be developed in parallel to expedite technology exploitation.,,AM offers significant benefits such as digital production flexibility, reduced material waste and component weight reduction. The exceptional design freedom inherent in AM will facilitate thin film deposition ultimately aiming for interpenetrating 3D structures of anode, electrolyte, cathode in solid-state, eliminating the conventional constraints and breaking the energy-power limit of current systems. c-Flash, developed for processing thin ceramic films, has significant benefits such as dramatically reducing sintering times and lowering peak sintering temperature. Enhanced ceramic electrical and mechanical properties are also possible, via microstructural changes from c-Flash processing. An increase in ceramic strength would enable thickness reduction and lower resistance with benefits for solid-state battery design and performance. c-Flash can be used to rapidly densify electrolyte material resulting in significant reduction of ion volatilisation during processing.,,The project will be guided by an industrial steering committee, representing a cross-section of the battery supply chain. The committee will offer advice and discuss/steer exploitation of technology as objectives are met.,,A breakthrough from this project could create a unique technology for exploitation in the UK. This technology would allow the UK to become a leader in low energy and low waste manufacturing methods. Solid-state batteries made by this route could take significant shares of the EV battery market and adoption by the UK battery supply chain would reinforce the UK's ability to grow and compete in this sector."," Domain: Battery Technology Level 1: Solid-State Battery Manufacturing Level 2: Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Contactless Field Enhanced Sintering (c-Flash) Techniques","Battery Technology","Solid-State Battery Manufacturing","Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Contactless Field Enhanced Sintering (c-Flash) Techniques","Battery Technology Solid-State Battery Manufacturing Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Contactless Field Enhanced Sintering (c-Flash) Techniques","Economy","Research and Development/Sustainable Energy"

Algreen chipboard using eco-friendly seaweed-based adhesive rather than petrol-based adhesive to glue the wastepaper chips. Thanks to Algreen's novel technology, Algreen chipboard is high-scalable, environmentally sustainable and VOC-free.,,**PROBLEM**,,Traditionally, chipboard is made by mixing particles or flakes of wood or jute-stick together with a resin and forming the mixture into a sheet. Chipboard is widely used for building construction and household furniture such as kitchen cabinets, bookcases, doors, windows, and covering the walls and floor.,,Most commercial chipboard is environmentally unfriendly, which contains highly toxic and carcinogenic adhesive, formaldehyde, which releases formaldehyde gas (VOC) into the atmosphere. Furniture containing formaldehyde can continue emitting small amounts of gas for up to 10 years.,,**MARKET**,,The global chipboard market reached a value of £15 Billion in 2020 (CAGR of 4.4% during 2021-2026).,,Countries including China, the United States, and Germany account for the largest markets in the furniture industry. China is the dominant exporter of wood furniture to the EU.,,China is the largest market base in the Asia-Pacific region, owing to its ever-increasing population, rising income, and rapid urbanization. It is also one of the major manufacturing hubs for almost every industry.,,After COVID, market recovery is speculated to be witnessed. Thus, the projected growing construction and furniture industries are expected to boost the demand in the local particle boards market in the post-pandemic recovery period.,,**ALGREEN SUSTAINABILITY**,,Recycling is a key global environmental concern, but especially when it comes to paper. Not only does it help to save trees, which is crucial to the sustainability of our planet, but recycling one tonne of paper, also saves at least 30,000 litres of water and between 3000 to 4000 kWh of electricity. This is enough to sustain an average three-bedroomed house for a whole year. Producing recycled paper also requires between 28-70% less energy consumption and uses less water.,,Open ocean seaweed farms can improve water quality. The World Bank predicts that achieving a global production of 500 million tons of seaweed by 2050 would absorb 10 million tons of nitrogen, which is 30% of the nitrogen estimated to enter the ocean, and 15 million tons of phosphorus. That same seaweed production of 500 million tons would consume 135 million tons of carbon, which is 3.2% of the carbon added to seawater each year from GHGs emissions."," Domain: Sustainable Materials Level 1: Alternative Materials for Construction and Furniture Level 2: Seaweed-based Chipboard in the Global Market ","Sustainable Materials","Alternative Materials for Construction and Furniture","Seaweed-based Chipboard in the Global Market ","Sustainable Materials Alternative Materials for Construction and Furniture Seaweed-based Chipboard in the Global Market","Manufacturing","Agriculture/Recycling/Construction/Furniture/Environmental Science"

519,"Over 4m people annually in the UK are affected by pain and immobility caused by a deficient meniscus, costing the equivalent of 1% GNP (NHS Business Plan 2017). The problem goes beyond age-related degenerative diseases and includes accidents/sports injuries in patients of any age. ,Technological challenges in developing load-bearing materials with suitable surface characteristics for such soft-tissue orthopaedic applications restrict options for treatment. In the absence of replacement devices, the standard of care for an irreparable meniscus is partial or complete removal (meniscectomy), with 2million/year such procedures world-wide (Li 2020).,,In response Orthonika, an SME spin-out from Imperial College London, has developed novel, reinforced load bearing PVA-PEG hydrogel materials for use in meniscus replacement. These unique materials are incorporated into an implant fixed directly to the bone via a reliable and established method.,,Hydrogels have long been thought of as highly promising materials for soft tissue replacements, potentially opening up new markets for orthopaedic implants. Their adoption has been hampered by poor mechanical properties and low fracture toughness. Laboratory tests have shown that Orthonika's PVA-PEG materials have exceptional mechanical and tribological properties that closely mimic those of natural tissue and are superior to the standard crosslinked PVA hydrogels currently in use for other applications.,,Building on previous work, Orthonika must now address technical challenges in product development to demonstrate GMP manufacturability for clinical-scale production and subsequent validation in ovine studies, targeting readiness for first-in-human clinical studies post-project.,,The project enables Orthonika to:,,* Manufacture at clinical-scale, bridging to development for commercial manufacturing post-clinical validation and,* Validate the TMR implant in ovine studies and therefore accelerate translation to human.,,This represents significant progression towards commercialisation/clinical uptake:,,* New surgical options for patients (alternatives to meniscectomy/TKR),* Enhanced healthcare capabilities (alignment with key performance indicators such as wait times and patient recovery),* Servicing a £1bn+ global market,* Potential adaptation to target other load-bearing orthopaedic applications (cartilage, intervertebral discs)."," Domain: Medical Technology Level 1: Innovative Meniscus Replacement Techniques Level 2: Development and Validation of PVA-PEG Hydrogel Implants for Ovine Studies","Medical Technology","Innovative Meniscus Replacement Techniques","Development and Validation of PVA-PEG Hydrogel Implants for Ovine Studies","Medical Technology Innovative Meniscus Replacement Techniques Development and Validation of PVA-PEG Hydrogel Implants for Ovine Studies","Healthcare","Orthopaedics/Technology"

87,"Nearly all of us have taken antibiotics: they really are a 'wonder drug' saving millions of lives every year, by specifically killing bacteria. They are rapidly becoming less effective as bacteria develop ways to resist them. An example of this is the spread of MRSA in hospitals. A recent review (The O'Neill Report) conducted by the UK government with the Wellcome Trust concluded that by 2050 antibiotic resistant infections would kill more people each year than cancer, and many common medical procedures such as hip replacements or Caesarean sections will become too dangerous to perform. New antibiotics are badly needed, and soil organisms have been one of the best sources of antibiotics over the last 70 years. However, soil organisms may only make an antibiotic under certain conditions which are hard to copy outside of their natural environment, which makes identification and exploitation difficult. Bactevo have isolated hundreds of organisms from the soil and hard-wired them to make all the chemicals they can make, including antibiotics, all the time. We then screen them for their ability to kill dangerous bacteria. The work is now progressing to advance these chemicals through to the creation of novel, effective antibiotics, ensuring future generations will have access to these vital drugs."," Domain: Medicine Level 1: Antibiotic resistance Level 2: Development of novel antibiotics from soil organisms","Medicine","Antibiotic resistance","Development of novel antibiotics from soil organisms","Medicine Antibiotic resistance Development of novel antibiotics from soil organisms","Biotechnology","Pharmaceutical Manufacturing"

530,"With the UK government's mandate to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, together with the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, there is no doubt that the battery market is going to experience rapid growth over the next 10 years. Solid-state batteries are a key technology to augment and replace current lithium-ion technology due to their increased safety and potential to achieve greater energy/power densities. ,Project partners, Lucideon, KWSP and Loughborough University will assess two complementary technologies, Additive Manufacturing (AM) and contactless Field Enhanced Sintering (c-Flash) to manufacture thin, textured/designed films of solid electrolytes for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. This new method of manufacturing addresses three of the main technological challenges with solid-state batteries: thin film processing, increasing electrolyte/electrode interfacial area and minimising ion volatilisation. This project will simultaneously target benefits in resource and energy efficiency, assessing the possibility of combining two novel and highly efficient technologies to exploit the strengths of both systems. The processes and pilot scale manufacturing will be developed in parallel to expedite technology exploitation.,,AM offers significant benefits such as digital production flexibility, reduced material waste and component weight reduction. The exceptional design freedom inherent in AM will facilitate thin film deposition ultimately aiming for interpenetrating 3D structures of anode, electrolyte, cathode in solid-state, eliminating the conventional constraints and breaking the energy-power limit of current systems. c-Flash, developed for processing thin ceramic films, has significant benefits such as dramatically reducing sintering times and lowering peak sintering temperature. Enhanced ceramic electrical and mechanical properties are also possible, via microstructural changes from c-Flash processing. An increase in ceramic strength would enable thickness reduction and lower resistance with benefits for solid-state battery design and performance. c-Flash can be used to rapidly densify electrolyte material resulting in significant reduction of ion volatilisation during processing.,,The project will be guided by an industrial steering committee, representing a cross-section of the battery supply chain. The committee will offer advice and discuss/steer exploitation of technology as objectives are met.,,A breakthrough from this project could create a unique technology for exploitation in the UK. This technology would allow the UK to become a leader in low energy and low waste manufacturing methods. Solid-state batteries made by this route could take significant shares of the EV battery market and adoption by the UK battery supply chain would reinforce the UK's ability to grow and compete in this sector."," Domain: Battery Technology Level 1: Solid-State Battery Manufacturing Level 2: Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Contactless Field Enhanced Sintering (c-Flash) Techniques","Battery Technology","Solid-State Battery Manufacturing","Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Contactless Field Enhanced Sintering (c-Flash) Techniques","Battery Technology Solid-State Battery Manufacturing Additive Manufacturing (AM) and Contactless Field Enhanced Sintering (c-Flash) Techniques","Economy","Research and Development/Sustainable Energy"
42,"Efficient distributed electricity generation using stationary fuel cells is recognised one option to address the energy trilemma, by improving the security of supply and reducing both CO2 and local emissions in a cost effective way. The ORACLE project aims to establish the technical and commercial feasibilty of novel concept to remove the sulphur containing odorants added to the natural gas supply that would otherwise poison these fuel cells. In doing so it addresses a known technology gap in the fuel cell industry. Success would quickly generate a significant new market opportunity for GR2L and Johnson Matthey, and establish Cambridge University at the forefront of a new research area. The partners will establish whether a technology called Chemical Looping Combustion, curently used to purify argon gas, can be redesigned to selectively destroy the contaminants in natural gas, enabling them to be trapped on a safe, high capacity absorbent. The idea builds on 2 patent filings and offers the potential for a unique fuel flexible, compact purification module for fuel cell developers, with excellent performance and cost characteristics."," Domain: Energy Level 1: Distributed Electricity Generation Level 2: Novel Concept of Chemical Looping Combustion for Fuel Cell Industry","Energy","Distributed Electricity Generation","Novel Concept of Chemical Looping Combustion for Fuel Cell Industry","Energy Distributed Electricity Generation Novel Concept of Chemical Looping Combustion for Fuel Cell Industry","Energy","Research and Development/Chemical Engineering"

427,"BREEZE, funded by EIT Food and co-funded by the European Union, is a revolutionary and environmentally friendly concept for fish health management, under development in response to the needs of salmon farming for new approaches and effective methods to improve the management of sea lice. ,The salmon farming sector is losing approximately US$1 billion each year due to ectoparasites such as sea lice. Their resistance to existing treatments, increased industry and consumer awareness of fish welfare, and a growing demand for treatment methods with minimum environmental impact are the principal drivers behind the project.,To further support the successful scaling of sustainably managed fish farms, Aqua Pharma Group has formed a consortium with Pulcea Ltd, Scottish aquaculture research and development company, and the prestigious Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The diverse and unique skillset will enable the development of an innovative new concept, code-named “BREEZE”.,,BREEZE rises to the challenge of increasing sea lice tolerance to bath treatments, while improving fish welfare and experience, validating, and minimising environmental impact, and helping farms avoid the financial losses they suffer as a result of sea lice.,,BREEZE takes existing hydrogen peroxide (oxygenated water) bath treatments and introduces an acoustic technology to counteract sea lice tolerance to treatments. BREEZE will ensure that little or no residue remains following release, making it suitable for use even in environmentally sensitive regions.,,The acoustic technology has proven to be especially effective against gravid female sea lice and their eggs and has been shown to be safe with no pathological or behavioural side effects for the fish.,,Further information on the project can be found in this leaflet and this video.,,About the Consortium:,,The BREEZE project has been structured to promote the Knowledge Triangle Integration (KTI) concept and the Consortium is a partnership from all three KTI fields: Aqua Pharma Group on the commercial side, Pulcea from the research field and the NTNU from academia.,The project is also supported by the University of Stirling, Scotland, providing scientific verification of the efficacy of the Pulcea technology. Other parties from the different sides of the knowledge triangle (our external partners SAIC, Solvay, and Novozymes) as well as salmon farming companies, will also be involved as the project progresses."," Domain: Aquaculture Level 1: Fish Health Management Level 2: Innovative Treatment for Sea Lice Tolerance","Aquaculture","Fish Health Management","Innovative Treatment for Sea Lice Tolerance","Aquaculture Fish Health Management Innovative Treatment for Sea Lice Tolerance","Aquaculture","Research and Development/Economy and Fisheries"

584,"Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models are powerful tools used by scientists studying cancer and in ,discovery of new cancer treatments. Each one is grown from a sample of a cancerous tumour donated by a,,cancer sufferer: so they are precious, valuable and useful. But scientists find it hard to find suitable ones,,for their work and so many spend a lot of time testing them, just to collect the same basic information over,,and over again. Repositive is creating an online platform for scientists to find PDX models and data to,,make sure that they are the best ones for their work. This project, costing £29,968 and lasting 3 months,,,funds us build the platform with the help of PDX model providers and pharmaceutical companies who use,,them often, and who will give us feedback on our concepts and designs. It will save 3 months of,,development time and will enable us to make sure that they find the platform valuable and use it when it,,is completed. In future it will help companies to save up to 6 months in drug discovery time, so that new,,treatments can be identified and brought to market more quickly and at lower cost than now.","Domain: Biomedical Level 1: Cancer Research Level 2: Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models and data ","Biomedical","Cancer Research","Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models and data ","Biomedical Cancer Research Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models and data","Pharmaceutical Manufacturing","Biotechnology"

This represents a significant technological leap as the necessary adapation of their production line should allow enough flexibility to maintain similar productivity rate."," Domain: Manufacturing Processes Level 1: Optimization of Allergen Segregation Level 2: Novel Processes for Minimizing Cross Contamination","Manufacturing Processes","Optimization of Allergen Segregation","Novel Processes for Minimizing Cross Contamination","Manufacturing Processes Optimization of Allergen Segregation Novel Processes for Minimizing Cross Contamination","Manufacturing","Food Technology"
454,"Just Jaks was founded in April 2011. The company specialises in making Childrens Fruity Oat Bar Baking Kits. Each baking kit contains our special oat mix alongside one of our dried fruit, seed and nut flavour combinations. We make our baking mixes from simple, wholesome ingredients and we use dried fruit to sweeten our oat bars so unlike many traditional oat snacks such as flapjacks you do not need to add sugar to this recipe. Also there are no artificial flavours, colours and preservatives in any of our kits.  We just pack our bars full of wholegrain and goodness."," Domain: Food and Nutrition Level 1: Healthy Snacks Possible Level 2: Children's Baking Kits and Oat Bars","Food and Nutrition","Healthy Snacks Possible","Children's Baking Kits and Oat Bars","Food and Nutrition Healthy Snacks Possible Children's Baking Kits and Oat Bars","Food and Beverage","Consumer Goods"

551,"The world is currently undergoing a strategic energy transition. Huge amounts of capital are being committed to renewable energy technologies in the way of debt funding, Venture Capital and Private Equity investment as well as insurance premiums and pension fund investments. ,Whilst financial market actors chase lucrative opportunities, the risks are also high. In particular, the potential for variability in asset performance presents significant challenges for those planning pricing strategies, pricing financial risk, monitoring financial exposures or assessing the attractiveness of potential future investments. Sound electricity market modelling is thus of significant value for financial services as well as energy operators.,,A common requirement is the need to understand how assets, or portfolios of assets, will perform over different future timeframes. The BELIEVE project will provide improved strategic insight on the future operational and financial performance of electricity generation assets across a range of business-relevant timeframes. We will do this through an enhanced capability to model future returns from generation assets ('economic dispatch').,,In the context of the BELIEVE project, 'economic dispatch' means the modelling of the market dynamics of energy systems. This capability is required by financial services organisations to explore the future revenue generation potential, and hence the valuation of, individual assets or portfolios of assets. This insight is required over a range of timeframes from months to decades. This contrasts with 'operational dispatch', which is about hourly or sub-hourly decision-making and is primarily the concern of asset operators.,,The current state of the art in economic dispatch tends to neglect the challenges posed by the increased penetration of variable renewable energy (primarily wind and solar). Through the BELIEVE project our aim is to enrich traditional economic dispatch modelling by incorporating the effects of weather variability, in both the present and future climates. We will demonstrate the utility of this enhanced modelling capability in markets with increasing proportions of variable renewable generation.,,The result will be a highly innovative and powerful modelling capability that represents a more comprehensive methodology for asset valuations, with the potential to provide significant additional insight for financial services actors.,,BELIEVE will be led by the Institute for Environmental Analytics, a leading centre for applied weather and climate analytics at the University of Reading."," Domain: Energy Transition Level 1: Strategic Energy Transition Level 2: Economic Dispatch Modelling for Renewable Energy Markets","Energy Transition","Strategic Energy Transition","Economic Dispatch Modelling for Renewable Energy Markets","Energy Transition Strategic Energy Transition Economic Dispatch Modelling for Renewable Energy Markets","Finance/Financial Services","Energy/Energy Technology"
486,"The project consortium, which includes M-Solv (process developer and small-scale capacitive touch sensor (CTS) manufacturer), Thomas Swan (graphene manufacturer), Printed Electronics Ltd (inkjet ink formulator) and University of Surrey, aims to bring innvoations to CTS manufacture. CTS comprises of structured transparent conductors (TC), which sense the capacitance variations when fingers approaches. Conventional CTS are made of TC, indium tin oxide (ITO), in which indium is known to be scarce and hence expensive in the near future. This project will explore the use of silver nanowire (AgNW), together with graphene to replace ITO for fabricating CTS at a much lower cost."," Domain: Materials Science and Engineering Level 1: Advanced Materials Level 2: Alternative Transparent Conductors for Capacitive Touch Sensors","Materials Science and Engineering","Advanced Materials","Alternative Transparent Conductors for Capacitive Touch Sensors","Materials Science and Engineering Advanced Materials Alternative Transparent Conductors for Capacitive Touch Sensors","Manufacturing","Research and Development/Electronics Production"
542,"One of the key barriers to the more widespread adoption of high performance carbon fibre-reinforced polymer composites in the automotive sector is the difficulty in achieving the required short cycle time, high volume production to satisfy the requirements of mainstream applications. With thermosetting-based composite systems this is particularly challenging because of their reliance on a definite cure schedule. Thermoplastic-based systems on the other hand, which can be reversibly heated, formed and cooled, offer more flexibility in this respect. Therefore, the objective of the proposed project is to develop a short cycle time, high volume manufacturing process for carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic components. The vision is to develop production technologies for the rapid “stamp-forming” of CFRP parts in a fashion that is somewhat analogous to the stamping of sheet metals. In addition to providing the automotive sector with a viable processing route for high performance composite components, the technology should also be transferable to medium volume aerospace parts."," Domain: Manufacturing Level 1: High Performance Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymer Composites Level 2: Short Cycle Time, High Volume Manufacturing Process for Thermoplastic Components","Manufacturing","High Performance Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymer Composites","Short Cycle Time, High Volume Manufacturing Process for Thermoplastic Components","Manufacturing High Performance Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymer Composites Short Cycle Time, High Volume Manufacturing Process for Thermoplastic Components","Manufacturing","Automotive/Aerospace"
